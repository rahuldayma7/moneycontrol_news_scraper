yes bank,20-07-2020,Yes Bank skids 40% since FPO price announcement; can it fall further?,"Shares of the private sector lender, Yes Bank, barring few sessions, have consistently been falling since the pricing announcement of the further public issue worth Rs 15,000 crore.

Since June 10, when the bank priced its FPO at a steep discount from the market price at that time, the stock has lost 40 percent of its value

On July 20, it was down 7 percent intraday and at 11:45 hours IST, it declined 2.02 percent to Rs 19.40 on the BSE.

The bank in consultation with merchant bankers had fixed FPO price at Rs 12-13 per share, which was 60-56.5 percent discount to the share price of June 9.

Majority of bids came in at lower end of price band i.e. Rs 12. In fact, anchor investors on July 14 invested Rs 4,098 crore in the public issue at same price, then during the public issue all bids, too, came in at same price.

We asked experts that can the stock price get adjusted to final issue price, which could be Rs 12, before listing? Majority of experts feel the stock price can go near its issue price.

The listing of fresh issue of Yes Bank is likely in the first half of next week.

""While we agree that the FPO was priced cheap considering the uncertainties like stressed asset quality and overall depressed financial performance would be expected in the foreseeable future in banking operations going forward. But we do also expect that there are high possibilities that the stock price will get adjusted to near FPO issue price of Rs 12 before listing or even dive down,"" Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities told Moneycontrol.

Arun Kejriwal, a primary capital market expert and owner of AK47, also feels the stock price may adjust near its issue price before the listing.

But Sumit Bilgaiyan, Founder of Equity99 seems to be disagree saying there may be a minor price correction but it may not get adjusted to Rs 12 as the primary reports suggest around 27 DIIs have subscribed for the FPO which indicates these investors have strong expectations of a turnaround and hence owing to these DIIs the liquidity shall remain healthy and steep correction remains unlikely.

""The way forward for the bank continues to see as that of dark clouds before the sunshine,"" he added.

The Rs 15,000 crore follow-on public offer was a fresh issue of equity shares and was opened for subscription during July 15-17, i.e. last week.

The issue was subscribed 95 percent including anchor book, but could not get strong subscription despite having a support from big institutions like SBI which has the maximum shareholding in the bank after Reconstruction Scheme in March this year.

""Finally Yes Bank FPO managed to sail through by end of Day 3, credit goes to SBI team, somehow if we see the subscription data, institutions seem to be having more faith in Yes Bank than individual investors. As per industry sources Yes Bank was expecting 3 times demand i.e. Rs 40,000 crore but failed to get attracted,"" Tapse said.

Way forward he believes the challenges will remain the same as overall, the bank will take longer time to revive and build a decent RoE numbers. ""Retail deposit is key for any bank for lower cost of funds but Yes Bank has witnessed sizable withdrawal of deposits over the past few quarters which raises concern. Hence based on current challenges and other fundamental parameters we advise investors to avoid,"" Tapse said.

The issue has received bids for over 847.86 crore equity shares against FPO size of more than 909.97 crore equity shares (excluding anchor book), the data available on the exchanges showed. If we include the anchor book portion, then the subscription stood at 95.14 percent.

The maximum bids were received at lower end of price band of Rs 12-13 per share. In fact, the anchor book, through which the lender had received Rs 4,098 crore, was also subscribed at Rs 12 per share.

The reserved portion of non-institutional investors has seen subscription of 63 percent and that of retail 46.96 percent and employees 32.62 percent, while the portion set aside for qualified institutional buyers was subscribed 1.90 times.

""We are pleased with the completion of our further public offering and would like to thank all the investors, partners and employees who have supported the issue. It is an important step in our journey of transformation and is a testament to the trust placed in the institution,"" Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO, Yes Bank said.

Also as per the prospectus, the bank had entered into the first underwriting agreement dated July 7 with SBI Capital Markets and the Registrar, and pursuant to which, SBI Capital Markets had agreed to underwrite Rs 3,000 crore worth of shares of FPO, at a price equal to the lowest end of the price band.

So overall the bank has received committed subscription of worth more than Rs 15,000 crore now.

""The issue already received required subscription of 90 percent out of total IPO size Rs 15,000 crore. It already received Rs 4,098 crore from anchor investors, more than Rs 8,700 crore worth of bids received so far (which gets changed till the issue closing today) and SBI Capital Markets already gave underwriting commitment of Rs 3,000 crore, which ultimately said the issue already subscribed over 90 percent,"" Arun Kejriwal, the primary capital market expert and owner of AK47.in told Moneycontrol.

The public issue has to receive minimum subscription of 90 percent of the offer, including through devolvement of underwriters, if applicable, within 60 days from the date of bid/offer closing date, as per the terms of the offer.

""We believe that the inflow of Rs 15,000 crore from the upcoming FPO will go a long way in strengthening the bank's balance sheet by enhancing its CET 1 ratio, solvency ratio, capital adequacy ratios, and would provide growth capital to the bank,"" said NVS Brokerage while recommending subscribe rating on this issue with an 18-24 month horizon.

""With its checkered history behind us, it appears that with a new management, Yes Bank has finally managed to put its house in order and the trajectory appears to be upward in the times to come,"" NVA added.

Yes Bank has been supported by marquee institutions – State Bank of India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC, Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank and IDFC First Bank which all had invested Rs 10,000 crore in the bank through Reconstruction Scheme in March this year.

The FPO is largely aimed to ensure adequate capital buffer to support growth plans, alongside absorbing further stress points from high NPA levels.

Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, SBI Capital Markets, Axis Capital, Citigroup Global Markets India, DSP Merrill Lynch, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India), ICICI Securities and Yes Securities India are the book running lead managers to the issue.

""The follow-on offer is available at a deep discount to the current market price, without lock-in period criteria, which makes it a unique investment opportunity,"" said KR Choksey while advising subscribe rating.

""While we see elevated stress pockets for the bank, we draw comfort from the backing of SBI as a key stakeholder (48.2 percent stake in Yes Bank as of June 2020 and lock-in period of 3 years) to absorb any shock,"" said the brokerage, adding the key investment risk remains the expected stress on its balance sheet; both from the lending portfolio and the investment book.

yes bank,13-07-2020,"Rossari Biotech IPO, Bharat Bond ETF & Yes Bank FPO: Where should investors put their money?","The bulls remained in control of Indian markets for the fourth week in a row and as we head into a new week, traders are spoilt for choice.

The week beginning from July 13 presents an opportunity for investors to choose from any of these three options--Rossari Biotech IPO, Yes Bank FPO and Bharat Bond ETF--and secure good returns.

Specialty chemicals manufacturer Rossari Biotech will open its nearly Rs 500-crore IPO for subscription on July 13. The price band of the issue, which closes on July 15, is set at Rs 423-425 per share.

The second tranche of the Bharat Bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) will open for bidding between July 14 and 17, with two more new ETFs maturing in 2025 and 2031.

The Bharat Bond ETF will be managed by Edelweiss AMC and the base size of the issue is Rs 3,000 crore with a green-shoe option of Rs 11,000 crore.

And, lastly, Yes Bank's capital raising committee on July 10 fixed a floor price of Rs 12 per equity share and cap price of Rs 13 per share for its follow-on public offer (FPO). The FPO issue will be open from July 15 to July 17.

All three options do look exciting but they cater to different segments of market participants and can't be bunched in one category. If someone wants to invest for long-term wealth creation, then ‘Bharat Bond ETF, Rosari Biotech, and Yes Bank IPO are preferred choice, filtered on the basis of wealth creation/protection of capital.

“Seeing the current market situation, we would advise investors to invest in Bharat ETF Bond for the long term because the return is predictable and also earlier bonds have delivered annualised return in the range of 14-18 percent. Additionally, it has a high credit rating and a good tool for diversification into debt,” Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Though Roosari Biotech has a strong product portfolio and it is well diversified, the company's valuation seems expensive. We would advise investors to wait until there is much clarity of the demand scenario and things getting stabilize.”

Mishra added that Yes Bank FPO is likely to help existing shareholders to dilute their holding, however, the impact of past issues is still lingering, and hence fresh investment is not advisable.

We spoke to several experts about their choice and here is what they said:

On July 9, investors borrowed 95,99,987 shares worth Rs 5.9 crore for an interest rate of around Rs 7 per share. Investors borrowed these shares for a one-month period, with settlement due on August 6.

These transactions took place a day prior to the announcement of the bank’s floor price for its Follow-on Public Offer (FPO). The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is expected to file the second prosecution complaint in the Yes Bank money laundering case on July 13. Close

The stock price has tumbled over 49 percent in the last 6 months and was trading at Rs 22.50, down Rs 3.00, or 11.76 percent at 09:23 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 23.50 and an intraday low of Rs 21.20.

ED may file the complaint against 13 individuals and entities including Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan. Yes Bank had sanctioned a loan of Rs 750 crore to Belief Realtor Pvt. Ltd, a company controlled by the DHFL group. The loan was sanctioned on June 18, 2018, by the Management Credit Committee (MCC) headed by Rana Kapoor, who was then the MD and CEO of Yes Bank.

yes bank,10-07-2020,SEBI may probe Yes Bank share transactions under SLBM after FPO announcement,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) may look into a large amount of share transaction of Yes Bank under the Securities Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (SLBM) on July 9, sources said. These transactions took place a day prior to the announcement of the bank’s floor price for its Follow-on Public Offer (FPO).

Yes Bank fixed the floor and cap price at Rs 12 and Rs 13, respectively, on Friday.

On Thursday, investors borrowed 95,99,987 shares worth Rs 5.9 crore for an interest rate of around Rs 7 per share. Investors borrowed these shares for a one-month period, with settlement due on August 6.

According to the National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) SLBM data, a large amount of borrowings started from June 30 onwards. There was a further surge last week after the announcement of the FPO.

If the high premiums under SLBM are taken into consideration, it amounts to paying a 26 percent interest to shareholders.

""This must definitely be investigated. It should not be too difficult to find out who is borrowing the stock at such premiums in the SLBM segment. If the dividend yield plus the SLBM return of any stock exceeds the risk-free rate of return, something is not right. That's usually a bearish indicator,” Chirag M Shah, market veteran and practising counsel, told Moneycontrol.

SLBM is the mechanism for short-selling shares in the cash market. Investors sell shares by borrowing from SLBM in the anticipation that they prices will fall later. Once that happens, they buy at a lower price and settle their trade. If prices rise, they stand to lose.

However, while borrowing shares, investors have to pay an interest

On June 30, 46,394,401 shares were traded; on July 1, 54,26,233 shares; on July 8, 60,33,711; and, on July 9, 95,99,587.

In the last 20 days, lending rates have increased by 3200 percent from Rs 0.25 to Rs 8. On June 22, the closing rate on SLBM was Rs 0.25.

“Prices going up or down is par for the course, but if something is happening in anticipation of a corporate action like an FPO, and the kind of abnormal SLBM returns this stock is offering, it must be investigated without delay,” Shah said.

During the Ketan Parekh scam in 2001, traders had used the ALBM (Automated Lending and Borrowing Mechanism) route for market manipulation. After several restrictions, SLBM came into place."
yes bank,10-07-2020,"Yes Bank FPO floor price fixed at over 50% discount, at Rs 12 per share","Yes Bank's capital raising committee on July 10 fixed a floor price of Rs 12 per equity share and cap price of Rs 13 per share for its follow-on public offer (FPO).

Employees of the bank will get a discount of Re 1 per share if bidding through Employee Reservation Portion, the lender said in a release. Investors will need to bid for a minimum of 1,000 equity shares and in multiples of 1,000 thereafter.

The decision is in regards to the public offering of equity shares of the face value of Rs 2 each by Yes Bank in accordance with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) provisions.

yes bank,02-07-2020,Amendments to bank resolution framework to help preserve depositor confidence: Moody's,"Moody's Investors Service on Thursday said the amendments to India's bank resolution framework are credit positive as they will help preserve depositor confidence.

On June 26 the government amended the Banking Regulation Act, 1948, allowing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to initiate the resolution of a weak bank by reconstructing its capital or merging it with another bank without the prior requirement of imposing a moratorium on its depositors or creditors.

“The amended resolution process is credit positive because it will help preserve depositor confidence and avoid deposit flight from a weak bank as the risk of a moratorium is reduced,” Moody's said in a statement.

The amendments are also credit positive for the bank's depositors and creditors because their ability to obtain full and timely repayments during the resolution process are unaffected, it afford.

Moody's said before the amendments, the RBI could only initiate the resolution process of a weak bank after seeking approval from the government to impose a moratorium on the bank's assets and liabilities for up to six months.

In March, RBI had imposed a moratorium on Yes Bank because of its weakening solvency and liquidity. Although the moratorium was lifted after 14 days, the bank saw a significant outflow of deposits in the run up to the moratorium and after it was lifted, the rating agency said.

Between December 2019 and March 2020, the bank's deposits fell 36 percent leading to sharp deterioration in its liquidity."

Also investors in troubled debt-ridden Yes Bank who have invested in shares at a price lower than the fair market value (FMV) have been given income tax (I-T) exemption on their discounted investment price.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) through a notification said the exemptions would come into effect from April 1, 2020, and shall be applicable for the assessment year 2020-21 and thereafter.

The I-T exemption has been given on any movable property, being unquoted shares, of a company and its subsidiary received by a shareholder, where, the tribunal on an application moved by the central government has suspended the board of directors of such company and has appointed new directors and where the resolution plan has been approved by the tribunal.

With regard to investors in Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020, the CBDT said equity shares received by the investor or the investor bank where the said share has been allotted by the reconstructed bank under the scheme at a price lower than the fair market value too would be exempt from the income tax.

Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Suraj Nangia said as per I-T Act, in case shares of a company are received for a consideration less than its fair market value (i.e. at a discount), then shareholder is required to pay tax on such discount.

“Vide present notification, the Government has apparently sought to encourage investors to participate in the Yes Bank Reconstruction scheme or any other scheme for reconstruction of a company in whose case proceedings u/s 241 and 242 of Companies Act are pending before the NCLT in cases of alleged oppression and mismanagement,” he said.

yes bank,23-06-2020,Icra downgrades Yes Bank Upper Tier II bonds to default rating,"Rating agency Icra has downgraded the ratings of Basel-II compliant Upper Tier II Bonds of Yes Bank to default rating. According to a release issued by the agency on Tuesday, the rating on Rs 1,344 crore worth Upper Tier II bonds has been downgraded to ICRA D rating from BB rating before.

The rating downgrade factors in the specific features of the instrument wherein the debt servicing is linked to the bank meeting the regulatory norms on capitalisation - CRAR of 9.0 percent, the rating agency said.

In case the bank reports a loss, the coupon or redemption can be paid with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), provided that on such payment, the CRAR remains above 9.0 percent.

While the bank has adequate liquidity for coupon payment, as per Basel guidelines, coupon is not payable if the CRAR is below the regulatory requirement. Since the bank is in advanced stages of capital raising, the bank sought RBI permission for the coupon payment which was not approved.

As a result, the timely servicing of the upcoming coupon, which is cumulative in nature remains constrained and the same is likely to be paid only when the bank achieves a CRAR of 9.0 percent, Icra said.

Under the new management, Yes Bank is presently in the process of raising capital. Icra said it will monitor the second phase of capital raising by the bank and could revise the outlook to positive or upgrade the ratings if bank is able to raise sufficient capital to meet the regulatory capital ratios on a sustained basis.

""Moreover, the stabilisation of the deposit base, continued improvement in the customer franchise by improving the share of retail deposits, and the ability to generate capital internally will be key trigger,"" the agency said.

On the negative side, a sustained decline in the scale of operations, leading to a delayed improvement in the operating profitability and inability to raise sufficient capital to meet the regulatory ratios (including CCB) on a sustained basis will be a credit negative, Icra said.

On Tuesday, Moneycontrol reported that the RBI has extended a special liquidity facility for Yes Bank for another three months. Yes Bank was bailed out early this year by a clutch of banks after the bank collapsed on account of high bad loans and deteriorating financials.

Interest payments on the bank's 10.25 per cent unsecured non-convertible upper tier-II bonds issued in 2012 is due on June 29 and the city-based lender had sought the RBI nod to honour the same.

""The Reserve Bank of India has expressed its inability to accede to the bank's request for payment of interest due as on June 29, 2020, since the bank does not meet the minimum capital requirements currently. Therefore, the bank would be unable to pay interest/coupon on the said upper tier II bonds which is due for payment on June 29, 2020,"" the bank informed the exchanges on Friday.

As per the June 25, 2012 memorandum at the time of issue of the bonds, the interest due will be accumulated and paid later once the bank complies with stipulated regulatory requirements.

Asserting that the bank has adequate liquidity to meet all its obligations, Kumar said the coupon on these bonds is cumulative in nature and any unpaid sum will become payable once the bank meets minimum regulatory capital ratio.

Yes Bank is considering a follow on public offer (FPO) to raise funds via equity.

The source also said keeping the current market condition in mind, the price band needs to be kept attractive.

The board also considered raising funds via a rights issue but shareholder banks, including SBI, were not in favour of the same and hence the FPO route is most likely to be chosen to initate a fund raise.

yes bank,06-05-2020,Yes Bank case | Enforcement Directorate to submit first charge sheet today,"The Enforcement Directorate may submit its first charge sheet against Yes Bank’s founder Rana Kapoor and his family on May 6 in a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Mumbai. The charge sheet will mainly focus on Rana Kapoor and his family members.

Sources told Moneycontrol that the ED may serve the charge sheet to his three daughters, wife and their companies, which have allegedly received benefits.

On March 8, the investigation agency had arrested Rana Kapoor after more than 30 hours of interrogation. It had initiated a money laundering investigation against him and others, based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case for alleged ‘suspicious’ transactions with Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) in 2018.

The ED learnt that Yes Bank had subscribed to debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore during April-June 2018 and simultaneously DHFL sanctioned a loan worth Rs 600 crore to Doit Urban Ventures (India), a family enterprise of the Kapoors. Kapoor’s three daughters -- Roshini, Radha and Raakhee -- are 100 percent shareholders of Doit Urban Ventures via another firm, Morgan Credits Pvt. DHFL is yet to pay back the Rs 3,700 crore invested by Yes Bank in its debentures.

ED said the loan was allegedly provided on a collateral of five properties, which have a meagre value, and by taking into account their future conversion from agricultural to residential land. The statements of several witnesses were recorded as part of the probe and according to which it appears that DHFL granted a loan of Rs 600 crore to Doit Urban Ventures on mortgage of the properties, whose acquisition cost was only Rs 39.66 crore, by showing their inflated value as Rs 735 crore, a source said.

“There has been no change in the status quo of the said plots: 7.79 acres in Alibaug and 91.63 acres in Raigad. Their collective worth was assessed at Rs 485 crore by DHFL, which that would have been realised only after converting their land-use and on development,” the source added.

A second source said Kapoor is accused of extending financial assistance to DHFL and others in lieu of substantial undue benefit to his family members and himself.

Kapoor is also in the ED’s cross-hairs about a Rs 750 crore loan to a firm allegedly controlled by the DHFL group for a redevelopment project in Bandra Reclamation. The ED, the second source said, is of the view that a portion of the loan was transferred to a DHFL-controlled company, which is yet to make an investment in the project.

As part of its investigation, the ED scanned records of around a 104 shell firms controlled by Kapoor and his family for irregularities. On April 26, the CBI arrested DHFL’s promoter director Kapil Wadhawan and his brother, the firm's former Non-Executive Director, Dheeraj.

Kapoor is also under its scanner for alleged irregularities linked to the grant of loan worth Rs 202.1 crore to a joint venture -- Mack Star Marketing Pvt -- of Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL) and De Shaw group between 2014 and 2016, ostensibly for the renovation/refurbishment of a barely two year-old office premises in Andheri, a third source said. The whole loan amount was allegedly siphoned off to HDIL group companies and were utilised to pay off its loans from Yes Bank, the source added.

The probe revealed that parts (around Rs 9.6 crore) of the total loan amount had been sanctioned by Yes Bank despite having received objections from De Shaw group, which holds 83.36 percent stake in the joint venture, a source said. The investor’s letter, dated March 18, 2016, notified Yes Bank that the loans extended to Mack Star were ""ultra vires to the JV’s articles since the investor hadn’t approved these loans.""

Out of the total loan amount, around Rs 160 crore was sanctioned for “refurbishment, modification and renovation” of a two-year old office premises constructed at a cost of around Rs 100 crore, the source said."
yes bank,03-05-2020,"With CKP Bank’s failure, yet another co-operative bank bites the dust: What’s ailing these lenders?","Late on May 2, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pulled the plug on Mumbai-based CKP Co-operative Bank.

The announcement did not come as a big surprise for many in the bank. Over the years, the bank’s financial position had worsened beyond redemption, bad loans had spiked significantly and the timeframe given by the central bank to work out a credible revival plan had expired. It was a race against time for the bank's management.

As on April 30, only about Rs 4 crore out of the Rs 158 crore loan book was remaining standard on the lender's books, Moreshwar Dhaimodkar, General Manager of CKP Bank told Moneycontrol. In other words, CKP Bank’s gross non-performing asset (GNPA) level had zoomed to 97 percent of the total loans.

Also read: CKP Co-operative Bank has 97% NPAs; most to real estate developers

As per the latest available details, the bank’s net worth had eroded to negative Rs 239 crore. At the last count, total deposits stood at Rs 486 crore, a relatively small amount compared to other bank failures.

But, for some of the 1.31 lakh customers of the bank, this will be their life’s savings. Once the bank goes into liquidation, depositors can claim up to Rs 5 lakh under the modified deposit insurance guarantee scheme. But, those having deposits in the bank beyond that ceiling may have a long and uncertain wait ahead.

What went wrong?

Founded in 1915, and headquartered at Matunga, Mumbai, the bank has eight branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts. CKP Bank's mistake was no different from that of many other failed cooperative banks — it built its business around a few large borrowers in the real estate sector. The strategy helped the small co-operative bank grow its loan book quicker than rivals, but backfired badly when the tide turned.

Almost all NPAs on CKP Bank’s book are loans given to small real estate developers. Things were good till about 2012 when the real estate business in Mumbai was booming. Banks built its loan book to around Rs 622 crore at one point. But eventually, some of these big ticket loans turned sticky. “Things were fine till a point. But, market turned bad and defaults started coming. About 10 builders owe much of the loans to the bank ,” said the official quoted above.

Starting 2014, the RBI imposed restrictions on CKP on deposit and advance operations. According to the official, the bank managed to recover some amount in the next few years but a meaningful resolution was not in sight. At end of the April 2020, CKP Bank still had about Rs 154 crore NPAs — almost equal to the size of its loan book. With the reserve bank terminating the operations of the bank, there is uncertainty ahead.

India’s co-operative banking mess

India’s weak co-operative banks have been imploding one after the other. Almost every month, the RBI brings some or the other co-operative bank under restrictions. In most cases, the reasons for failure are financial irregularities or frauds that eventually result in huge spike in NPAs, pushing these banks to the point of collapse. The fact that co-operative banks are traditionally poorly regulated as compared to commercial banks, adds to the woes.

Consider this: for nearly two years, there has been no proper scrutiny of the accounts of many cooperative banks, including Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), due to dual regulation and political involvement at state-level. “You have a problem when you do not have clarity on who does what and you are unwilling to own up mistakes when things go wrong. Too many cooks spoil the broth,” an RBI official said on condition of anonymity.

Regulation of UCBs is split between RBI and Centre/state governments, while that of smaller co-operative banks is divided between the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and state governments. The regulation of multi-state UCBs fall under the Ministry of Agriculture while that of single-state UCBs come under the Ministry of Finance. Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative bank (PMC) is a multi-state co-operative bank.

RBI or government?

The reserve bank does regulate these banks, but only partly. For instance, when it comes to taking the stock of operations, the Registrar of Co-operative Society (RCS) is the primary authority on behalf of government. Typically, an IAS official on the verge of retirement, the RCS is entrusted with conducting regular scrutiny of these banks and compiling the numbers. But politicians at the state level dominate the running of these banks, and the RCSs are either powerless or in cahoots with the powers-that-be.

According to the latest available data on the RBI website, India had 1,551 urban co-operative banks (UCBs) by March-end 2018. These banks managed Rs 4.5 lakh crore deposits at that point of time. At the state level, there are three types of cooperative banks — primary credit co-operative banks, district level cooperative banks and state-level cooperative banks. As on March-end 2017, there were about 33 state co-operative banks with Rs 1.2 lakh crore deposits, 370 district central co-operative banks (Rs 3.3 lakh crore deposits) and 95,595 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (Rs 1.15 lakh crore deposits).

PMC effect

PMC bank, which was superseded by the RBI in September 2019, after it was found that the bank was allegedly running fraudulent transactions for several years to facilitate lending to HDIL through fictitious accounts and violating single-party lending rules. The bank had Rs 11,600 crore in deposits. The RBI imposed restrictions on deposit withdrawals and superseded its board after the fraud was caught. Last week, the Bombay High Court constituted a committee to sell HDIL assets and repay depositors.

The RBI has now asked UCBs to report details on borrowers with exposure of Rs 5 crore and above, also when the bank writes off loans worth that amount. “Banks are advised to take utmost care about data accuracy and integrity while submitting the data on large credits to the Reserve Bank of India, failing which penal action would be undertaken,” the central bank said in a recent circular.

After PMC, the RBI imposed restrictions on Bangalore-based Guru Raghavendra Sahakara (Co-operative) Bank Niyamitha, on January 10, from renewing loans and deposits. The bank was also asked not let withdrawals beyond Rs 35,000 per account. Similar restrictions were imposed on Kolkata’s Kolikata Mahila Cooperative Bank Ltd. with deposit withdrawal restrictions of Rs 1,000 per account. On April 17, the RBI cancelled the license of Mapusa Urban Co-operative Bank for financial failure. There are several other such examples.

Not just UCBs

The problem of dual regulation or lack of efficient regulation is not limited to only UCBs, but also for rural co-operative banks. Even rural co-operative banks, which are regulated by RCS and National Bank of Agriculture Development (NABARD), are run opaquely. Here too, for the last two years, no data on the business of these banks are available.

“These banks are mostly run by politicians and monitored by RCS. There is often a turf war on who does the job. There are no numbers available for the last two years,” a NABARD official said on condition of anonymity.

Learning from the PMC episode, the government in February conferred more powers to the RBI to regulate co-operative banks through an amendment in the Banking Regulation Act. With this amendment, the RBI will have more power to audit the books of urban co-operate banks, appoint Chief Executive Officers and audit co-operative banks. But even now, the proposed changes in the Banking Regulation Act will cover only the urban co-operative banks and not the rural co-operatives.

A resolution is not in sight even after six months of the RBI superseding the PMC board. Compare this with the super-quick resolution of Yes Bank by a clutch of private banks and the State Bank of India, with the help of the RBI. There are no takers for crisis-ridden co-operative banks. The reason is that many of these entities have opaque balance sheets. CKP Bank is the latest instance of a cooperative bank failure. But, it is unlikely to be the last.

yes bank,06-04-2020,Kotak Mahindra Bank's deposits grow by 12% in Jan-March quarter despite Yes Bank hangover,"Post-Yes Bank fiasco, the private banking industry is suffering from a major trust deficit. Some of the private banks such as IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank have witnessed erosion in their deposit portfolios.

However, banks like Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank have bucked the trend. On April 6, Kotak Mahindra Bank said its deposits have grown by 11.7 percent since December 2019. The total deposits of the bank grew from Rs 2.31 lakh crore on December 31 to an estimated Rs 2.58 lakh crore in March 2020, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

Of this, savings accounts have grown by Rs 91,729 crore to Rs 1.04 lakh crore or by 14 percent, the bank said, while current deposits grew by 17 percent from Rs 36,788 crore to Rs 43,000 crore. The ratio of current and savings account deposits to total deposits stands at 56.2 percent as of March 2020, compared to 53.7 percent in December.

At the same time, net advances have grown nearly flat on a quarter on quarter basis to Rs 2.19 lakh crore, the bank said.

On April 5, HDFC Bank also announced that its deposits have grown by 7.4 percent in the January-March quarter to Rs 11.46 lakh crore.

But both IndusInd and RBL have witnessed a decline in deposits. IndusInd Bank in a regulatory filing on March 30 said its deposits have shrunk by 10-11 percent since Q3. The bank attributed much of this (about 70 percent) to some government- accounts moving money out of the bank and rest by corporate houses. The hit on the retail book was less, it said.

""This (fall in deposits) will also result in lower CASA ratio, but reduce our dependency on this category for deposits in future,"" the bank said. Similarly, RBl Bank said it has seen 8 percent decline in its deposit book.

Until Yes Bank's collapse, new-age private banks were seen as preferred entities for several institutions, including government entities, due to competitive interest rates and tech-enabled customer services. This image has taken a beating after the Yes Bank episode."
yes bank,03-04-2020,"Yes Bank crisis, faltering economy weigh heavily on IndusInd Bank. Can it weather the storm?","The Yes Bank crisis and a deteriorating economic environment continue to take a toll on the health of private banks such as IndusInd Bank.

On April 3, global rating agency Moody's placed private lender's domestic and foreign currency issuer ratings of Baa3/P-3 under review for downgrade.

""The review for downgrade of IndusInd's ratings reflects the downside risks to asset quality amid the deteriorating macroenvironment and financial market volatility. The bank's loan portfolio includes a relatively higher proportion of micro finance and vehicle finance loans than its peers, which are at high risk of being negatively impacted by the economic shock as customers in these segments tend to have limited buffers to withstand economic stress,"" the agency said.

Further, IndusInd's funding is weak when compared to other-rated Indian banks, as reflected by its high deposit concentration and low share of retail deposits.

This makes the bank more susceptible to the dislocations in the financial markets, including on wholesale funding sources, Moody’s said.

Yes Bank crisis hangover

The collapse of Yes Bank has created significant risk aversion towards private banks, even for institutions. IndusInd Bank, in a filing to the BSE on March 30 said its deposits have shrunk by 10-11 percent since Q3.

The bank attributed much of this (about 70 percent) to some government- accounts moving money out of the bank and rest by corporate houses.

The hit on the retail book was less, it said.

""This (fall in deposits) will also result in lower CASA ratio, but reduce our dependency on this category for deposits in future,"" the bank said.

Remember, IndusInd was the first to feel the heat of Yes Bank's collapse as it had to defer a meeting to discuss capital raising.

Still, analysts do not believe that there is anything fundamentally wrong with these banks except the general industry issues.

""The high-risk aversion that arose after the Yes Bank crisis is playing out. I don't know how long this will stay. But, such deposit erosion doesn’t look good for banks,"" said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global Securities.

According to a research report by Emkay, the erosion in institutional deposits in IndusInd Books was replaced by certificate of deposits and borrowings and eventually will be replaced with retail deposits.

These banks will also see stress in asset quality on account of COVID-19-induced lockdown, especially in microfinance, real estate, vehicle finance segments, the report said.

Surprisingly, government-related accounts are in a panic mode even after Reserve Bank of India's appeal to state governments, asking them not to withdraw money from private banks.

""We strongly believe that such a move can have banking and financial sector implications. We would like to point out that the Reserve Bank had adequate powers to regulate and supervise the private sector banks and by using these powers it has assured that the depositors’ money is entirely safe,"" a report in The Economic Times said.

IndusInd has a Rs 21,000 crore MFI book, which is about 10 percent of the total lending book and nearly a similar chunk of real estate loans. The recovery in these accounts will depend on the economic recovery after the COVID-19 panic settles down

""We believe that the bank's near-term performance will track its ability to manage COVID-19-led disruption on its growth/asset quality,”Emkay said.

In Q3 FY20, IndusInd reported NPAs to the tune of Rs 4,578 crore, which, in percentage terms, is nearly flat on a sequential basis.

Adding the restructured loans part, the gross NPAs come to around 2.27 percent. The bank has a capital adequacy ratio of 15.43 percent. Out of its total loan book of Rs 2,0,7413 crore, only about 46 percent comprises corporate loans. A closer look at the corporate portfolio shows a diversified book with significant exposure to large corporations (25 percent).

Not just IndusInd, even RBL Bank too has seen about 8 percent erosion in its deposit book.

In RBL Bank's case too, asset quality worries persist on account of present economic environment.

In an interview to CNBC-TV 18, RBL Bank's Chief Executive Officer Vishwavir Ahuja had said recovery in portfolios such as SME will depend on the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the cash flows of companies.

Until Yes Bank's collapse, new-age private banks were seen as preferred entities for several institutions, including government entities, due to competitive interest rates and tech-enabled customer services. This image has taken a beating after the Yes Bank episode.

So, what lies ahead for private banks?

""It is difficult to say at this stage how long the problems will persist. These banks will have to work out a way to restore customer trust and thus prevent further outflow of deposits,"" said Purohit."

yes bank,31-03-2020,SEBI imposes Rs 1 crore fine on Yes Bank's two promoter entities for disclosure lapses,"Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday imposed a penalty of Rs 50 lakh each on two promoter entities of Yes Bank for not making requisite disclosures pertaining to encumbrance of shares. The two entities that have been penalised are Yes Capital (India) and Morgan Credits.

It was alleged that by not making requisite disclosures of encumbrances of shares of Yes Bank to the stock exchanges and the lender, the two promoter entities have violated the provisions of SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover ) Regulations.

Yes Capital had raised Rs 630 crore from Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund through unlisted Zero Coupon Non-Convertible Debentures ('ZCNCD') in September 2017. As a part of the transaction, Yes Capital acceded to a condition that it will maintain a cover ratio of 3.3 times till 12 months and 3 times thereafter.

Besides, Morgan Credits had raised Rs 950 crore from Reliance Mutual Fund through unlisted ZCNCD in April 2018 and as a part of the transaction, Morgan Credits acceded to a condition that it will always maintain a cap on the borrowing cap at 0.5 times.

As per the shareholding pattern of Yes Bank filed with the stock exchanges as on March 31, 2019, Yes Capital and Morgan Credits held 3.27 per cent and 3.03 per cent stake, respectively in the private lender.

Based on the observations, Sebi examined whether the conditions of maintaining a 'Cover ratio' or 'Borrowing cap' as part of borrowings by these promoters can be construed as a form of 'encumbrance' on shares of the bank.

In its submission to Sebi in March 2019, Yes Bank had said that it was not privy to the transactions entered into by Yes Capital and Morgan Credit and it has not received any disclosure from them both about any encumbrance on their shareholding in the bank.

Further, stock exchanges — BSE and NSE —in February 2019 had stated that no disclosures were made to them with respect to these transactions.

Sebi found that the “transactions carried out by the noticee (Yes Capital and Morgan Credits) by way of raising funds through unlisted ZCNCD with the conditions of maintaining a 'Cover ratio / 'Borrowing Cap' as part of borrowings is construed as a form of 'encumbrance' on the underlying shares of YBL (Yes Bank Ltd) held by noticees and that by not making requisite disclosures of the said encumbrances on shares of YBL held by them to stock exchanges and YBL, the noticees have violated the provisions of ...the SAST Regulations”.

Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has levied a fine of Rs 50 lakh each on Yes Capital and Morgan Credits.

SAST Regulations require a promoter to disclose encumbrance of its shares and the term 'encumbrance' include a pledge, lien or any such transaction, by whatever name called.

Further, through the frequently asked questions (FAQs), it has also been clarified by Sebi that non-disposal undertakings are also included in such disclosure."

""Marquee overseas investors, including the likes of private equity giant Carlyle, Canada’s Brookfield, US-based Tilden Park Capital and other global suitors, may explore an investment in Yes Bank post May 2020,"" one person told Moneycontrol.

Another person familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol that if the investment plans fructify, this second round may see a combined fund infusion of around Rs 10,000 crore from foreign investors.

""The pricing will be finalised based on SEBI norms,"" he said.

A third person said as of now, the plan is to issue new shares to these foreign investors and either the preferential allotment or QIP route could be used in lieu of a minority stake. ""The first round has seen an infusion of around Rs 11,000 crore and an additional Rs 10,000 crore should put the bank in a comfortable position,"" the person said.

One of the potential investors, Carlyle Group, an American multinational private equity firm, has worked closely with SBI on past investments in India. It made a partial exit recently from SBI Cards as the credit card issuer made its D-street debut with a Rs 10,000-crore IPO.

In March 2019, Carlyle made its biggest investment in India by picking up 9 percent of SBI Life Insurance for Rs 4,635 crore. In November 2019, it made a partial exit in the insurer by selling a 3 percent stake. According to media reports, the private equity major has also sealed a $1.5-billion India-focussed distressed asset fund with SBI.

Canada-based Brookfield, on its part, has entered the Indian financial services space by purchasing a 40 percent stake in NBFC Indostar Capital Finance for Rs 1,450 crore.

Carlyle declined to comment for this article. Moneycontrol is awaiting responses from Yes Bank, SBI, Brookfield and Tilden Park Capital and will update this article with their responses.

THE YES BANK BAILOUT

In a government monitored rescue act, SBI, India's largest lender, approved the infusion of Rs 7,250 crore at Rs 10 a share for a 49 percent stake in Yes Bank on March 12, 2020. SBI was joined by other lenders such as HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IDFC First Bank, Federal Bank and Bandhan Bank, which collectively pumped in Rs 3,950 crore and picked up minority stakes.

All these lenders are already sitting on handsome gains, as the Yes Bank stock has surged by 115 percent in and the market capitalisation has risen more than ten-fold to Rs 67,647 crore in the past week.

Earlier this week, Yes Bank said it resumed normal banking operations after the cash-starved bank was placed under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on March 5, 2020, to protect the interest of depositors. The RBI aso superseded the board, including capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per depositor as the bank’s erstwhile management failed to present a credible resolution plan.

Former SBI CFO and Deputy Managing Director Prashant Kumar has been appointed as the new managing director and CEO of Yes Bank, which also reconstituted its board of directors. ""Yes Bank has taken adequate measures to restore banking services and ensured that the branches and ATMs have adequate supply of cash. However, there is no need to need for customers to rush for withdrawals and there is absolutely no issue on the liquidity front,"" Kumar said earlier this week.

Due to its failure to raise capital, Yes Bank has witnessed a sharp outflow of deposits in the past few quarters. Its deposit base shrunk by around Rs 28,000 crore between December 31, 2019 and March 5, 2020.

Since March 31, 2018, the deposit base has declined by over Rs 63,000 crore, according to Crisil. The bank's asset quality also remains a matter of concern with gross non-performing assets (NPA) rising to 18.9 percent in the third quarter. Yes Bank also posted a loss of Rs 18,564 crore, its largest in a quarter."
yes bank,20-03-2020,Coronavirus impact: Fitch Ratings cuts India's FY21 growth forecast to 5.1%,"Fitch Ratings on March 20 cut India's growth forecast to 5.1 percent for FY 2020-21, saying the coronavirus outbreak is likely to hit business investment and exports. Fitch in December 2019 projected India's growth at 5.6 percent for 2020-21 and 6.5 percent in the following year.

In its Global Economic Outlook 2020, Fitch said the number of people affected by coronavirus will keep rising in the coming weeks but the outbreak will remain contained. However, there are downside risks to this scenario.

""Supply-chain disruptions are expected to hit business investment and exports. We see GDP growth to remain broadly steady at 5.1 percent in the fiscal year 2020-2021 following growth of 5.0 percent in 2019-2020,"" Fitch said.

For 2021-22, Fitch projected India's growth to be 6.4 percent.

""The outbreak of the virus is hitting sentiment, while local governments have rolled out measures to contain the spread of the virus, such as closing schools, cinemas and theatres. While India's linkages with China (e.g. trade and tourism) are modest, manufacturers in India are heavily reliant on key Chinese intermediate inputs – especially of electronics and machinery and equipment,"" Fitch said.

The WHO has declared coronavirus pandemic. Over 2 lakh people have been infected globally and the disease caused by it — COVID-19 — has claimed over 9,000 lives. In India, there are about 195 positive cases and 4 deaths so far from the deadly virus.

The difficulties facing the Indian economy have been exacerbated by Yes Bank failure, it said.

""Fragilities in the financial system will further undermine sentiment and domestic spending. The overall financial system remains burdened with weak balance sheets, which will limit any upside to credit and growth despite policymakers' efforts in recent months to ease stresses,” Fitch added."

The fixed deposit (FD) account of the temple has accrued a total interest of Rs 8.23 crore.

""As per the term of condition of FD placed with us, Yes Bank Ltd has fully paid all the quarterly interest on time up to December 31, 2019. The remaining interest that has accrued till March 19, 2020, has been remitted along with the principal amount of Rs 389 crore to SBI account of Jagannath Temple Corpus Fund,"" Yes Bank on March 19 said in a letter, accessed by PTI.

In the letter addressed to Chief Administrator Krishan Kumar of the famous temple shrine in eastern India, Yes Bank said it has two more FDs of Rs 156 crore which will be transferred by the end of this month.

These FDs of Rs 156 crore are also under no-premat option which does not allow the bank to pay prematurely, the letter said.

""As the extended guidelines of the regulator, we shall remit the principal amount of Rs 156 crore and interest up to date on the date of maturity that is March 30, 2020, to the designated account of Jagannath Temple Corpus Fund...to SBI Main Branch Puri,"" Yes Bank said in the letter undersigned by its Senior Vice-President Jaydev Das.

yes bank,19-03-2020,Yes Bank branches look deserted after moratorium lifts,"A day after the moratorium on Yes Bank was lifted, many of its branches bore a deserted look, partly amid fear of coronavirus infection. The bank resumed full operations from 6 pm on March 18, after being under moratorium for 13 days.

PTI visited four branches of the private lender - two in the central suburb and two in Navi Mumbai, where hardly one to two customers were seen.

“Panic has reduced as we know that this bank is not going to shut shop. The presence of an investor like SBI has given us confidence,” said a customer.

On Wednesday evening, the bank in a tweet said all its banking services were operational and customers would be able to experience the full suite of services.

It has also extended banking hours for three days starting today.

Under the Yes Bank reconstruction scheme, SBI along with seven financial institutions infused Rs 10,000 crore in the private lender.

SBI alone has invested Rs 6,050 crore into the bank.

Other investors include ICICI Bank and HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore each) Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore each) and IDFC First (Rs 250 crore).

The RBI had put restriction on the troubled lender on March 5, 2020, under which customers of the bank were allowed to withdraw up to Rs 50,000 till April 3.

yes bank,19-03-2020,India Ratings and Research revises rating watch on Yes Bank to 'evolving',"Yes Bank today said that India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has revised rating watch on the bank's long-term issuer rating of 'IND BB-' to rating watch evolving (RWE) from rating watch negative (RWN). The RWE indicates the possibility of the ratings being either upgraded, downgraded or affirmed.

""Ind-Ra has revised the rating watch on Yes Bank Ltd's long-term issuer rating of 'IND BB-' to RWE from RWN,"" Yes Bank said in a filing to the BSE.

The revision of the rating watch follows the systemic support Yes Bank has received recently, in terms of both equity and liquidity, from the new set of investors and the regulator for its reconstruction.

It also considers the pressure that could show up on the liabilities once the regulator-imposed moratorium is lifted.

Ind-Ra had downgraded the bank's ratings and maintained them on RWN on March 6, 2020; in the agency's opinion, the temporary regulator-imposed moratorium resulted in the bank not being able to follow through with settlement and transaction requests, the filing said.

Subsequently, the bank declared its third quarter results.

Its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) increased to 18.87 percent in 3QFY20 from 7.39 percent in 2QFY20 while its net NPAs grew to 5.97 percent from 4.35 percent.

""This implies the additional recognition of Rs 230 billion as non-performing till the time of publishing the 3QFY20 results and not just end-December 2019. Including this, the total stressed book including non-fund limits to the same accounts is about Rs 490 billion,"" the filing said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had put restriction on the lender on March 5, under which the bank''s customers were allowed to withdraw up to Rs 50,000 till April 3.

The shares were sold through a block deal on the NSE, stock exchange data showed. The sale makes about 14 percent of Kapur's stake. Prior to the sale, Kapur held 17.6 crore shares in the bank.

Kapur also pledged an additional 0.098 percent, or 25 lakh shares, of her family's shareholding of 6.87 percent in the bank.

In an exchange filing, the bank said Kapur, its single largest promoter and the widow of founder –chairman Ashok Kapur, had only 0.117 percent, or 3 lakh shares, which were not pledged.

The stock had gained 1,484 percent in just eight trading sessions as the cabinet approved the RBI’s restructuring plan for the private lender.

The RBI, State Bank of India and new CEO & MD Prashant Kumar’s assurances to depositors boosted investors’ confidence who bought the stock as other shares crashed over coronavirus fears.

But brokerages are not convinced with the rally and some of them have suspended their coverage or maintained a “sell” rating on the stock.

The rally is more technical than fundamental, as while the capital infusion and AT1 bonds write-off has helped Yes Bank stay afloat, its fundamentals still remain weak, JM Financial has said.

A loss of more than Rs 18,500 crore reported by the bank in Q3FY20 with pro-forma CET1 at 7.6 percent (post capital infusion and AT1 write-off) clearly shows the problem.

According to a Twitter poll commissioned by Moneycontrol, a majority of Yes Bank customers will withdraw the entire money deposited in the troubled lender, which required a government-led bailout.

Up to 53 percent of the respondents said they would take their money out, the poll commissioned on March 18 found. Only 27.4 percent said they would keep their money, while 7.2 percent said they would deposit more money in their accounts.

The stock, which has zoomed more than 85 percent in the last five days, was quoting at Rs 46.40, down Rs 14.40, or 23.68 percent. It touched an intraday high of Rs 62.00 and an intraday low of Rs 45.15."

While before he was asked to leave the bank by RBI in August 2018, Kapoor and his family had held over 13 per cent equity in the bank, last November he sold his entire stake barring 900 shares. The Kapur family had over 9 per cent which successively brought down to 6.87 per cent."

The moratorium has been lifted and banking services are now operational. Yes Bank's branches will open an hour earlier, at 8.30 am, from March 19 to March 21, with extension in banking hours for senior citizen customers, the bank said via a tweet.​

During a press meet on March 17, the RBI-appointed administartor Prashant Kumar outlined why he did not expect a run on the bank when the moratorium is lifted.

“Only one-third customers withdrew during moratorium period where there was a withdrawal restriction of up to Rs 50,000,” Kumar said. “All our ATMs and branches have enough money and I want to reiterate that there is absolutely no problem with liquidity,” said Kumar.

Though the rescue deal has been planned well, the bank’s tryst with its Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bondholders, having Rs 8,415 crore worth of such papers, is unlikely to end any time soon. The stage is set for a long legal battle after investors moved the Bombay High Court shortly after the RBI's decision to write down these papers became public."

The stock has gained 1,484 percent in just eight trading sessions as the cabinet approved the Reserve Bank of India’s restructuring plan for the private lender.

The RBI, State Bank of India and new CEO & MD Prashant Kumar’s assurances to depositors were enough to boost investors’ confidence who bought the stock as other shares crashed over the coronavirus outbreak fears.

JM Financial says the rally is more technical than fundamental, as while the capital infusion and AT1 bonds write-off has helped Yes Bank stay afloat, its fundamentals still remain weak.

The more than Rs 18,500 crore loss reported by the bank in Q3FY20 with pro-forma CET1 at 7.6 percent (post capital infusion and AT1 write-off) clearly shows the problem.

Gross non-performing loans (NPLs) for the bank were elevated at 18.9 percent as of Q3FY20, with provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 73 percent, and even so, the bank's press statement continued to guide for 5 percent slippages in FY21.

Further, the bank indicated that 60 percent of its corporate bond book was stressed and the PCR on the same was at 39 percent.

""As a result, we believe credit costs will continue to remain elevated for Yes bank in the medium term and the path to profitability may be prolonged. Furthermore, this implies that Yes Bank may require more equity capital infusions to maintain regulatory capital adequacy,"" JM Financial said.

The bank will get Rs 10,000 crore capital infusion from State Bank of India (Rs 6,250 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,000 crore), HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore) and IDFC First Bank (Rs 250 crore).

The moratorium period, which included withdrawal of up to Rs 50,000, will end at 6 pm on March 18 after which Yes Bank will resume normal operations.

SBI has to keep at least a 26 percent stake in the bank for the next three years. Non-SBI investors will have a three-year lock-in for 75 percent of their investment.

""Interestingly at CMP, Yes Bank's new shareholders are sufficiently in-the-money to recover their entire investments by just offloading 17 percent of their allotted shares (since they invested at Rs 10 per share and CMP is Rs 59) versus the cap of 25 percent,"" the brokerage said.

""While investing banks have answered the call for capital from the regulator, we believe that they may look to offload Yes Bank shares once the allotted shares are eligible for trading,"" it added.

After the moratorium kicked in, a lot of mid and small sized banks saw sharp correction as well as flight-to-safety deposits to larger and “more stable” banks, though RBL Bank management said they were getting their deposits back and operations were normal.

Even Prashant Kumar said they saw more inflows than outflows in the last couple of days.

""Increasing risk aversion in the system has meant that smaller corporates/SMEs continue to struggle in terms of credit availability. In our view, the credit crunch in the economy could aggravate and thus could delay the growth recovery further,"" JM Financial said.

Credit costs may remain elevated, as systemic asset quality pressures for certain sectors persist, which may further be exacerbated by the Yes bank episode, the brokerage said.

Hence, it continued to prefer larger banks (ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank) with better economies of scale, strong liability franchises and lower exposures to weaknesses in mid-corporates and SMEs.

""Moreover, these larger banks have seen sharp corrections and are now quoting at attractive valuations (ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank trading at 1.2x, 1.5x and 2.5x FY21E BVPS for the core banking businesses),"" it said.

Sachin Talawdekar, who deals in power supply and back-up equipment, has received a notice from the Yes Bank in September last year, Mumbai Mirror reported.

Talawdekar owns Global Techno India, a company that deals with power back-up solutions, UPS, batteries, generators and inverters. He operates from his flat in Prabhavati Tower in Khopat and has an annual turnover of just Rs 25 lakh.

Shocked to receive the notice, Talawdekar has been running from pillar to post to have it withdrawn, the report said. He has sent a legal notice to the bank, asking it to withdraw its notice. But he has not gotten any reply.

He has reportedly approached the local Rabodi police station seeking action against the bank for harassment.

The notice states that he should pay the entire amount that he owes to one Dion Global Solutions directly to Yes Bank, the report quotes Talawdekar as saying. However, he claimed that he has nothing to do with the mentioned firm.

The bank claimed that Dion owes some Rs 152 crore to it and Talawdekar was one of the debtors of the firm, the report said. Talawdekar said he has never dealt with Dion or Yes Bank.

After receiving the notice, Talawdekar visited the local branch of Yes Bank at Thane's Talav Pali. He later approached the Rabodi police station where police 'fixed his meeting with bank officials', the report stated.

Bank officials took all relevant documents from him and told him that they will communicate with their Delhi office, which had issued the notice, but they have not yet reverted, the report quoting Talawdekar as saying.

Deepak Varhade, a police officer attached to the Rabodi police station, told the publication that the bank officials claim that the notice was probably sent to the man by mistake and he does not need to worry.

Finally the moratorium on Yes Bank, which started in the evening on March 5 with a condition to withdraw only up to Rs 50,000 per person, will end at 6 pm on March 18, much before the earlier scheduled date of April 6, 2020. All operations will resume as usual from tomorrow evening.

The moratorium on Yes Bank will finally be lifted on March 18 at 6 pm, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said in the press conference on March 16.

All operations will resume as usual from tomorrow evening and the new board will assume the position on March 26.

While addressing a press conference, Prashant Kumar, new MD and CEO of Yes Bank, said, all ATMs were full of cash and there was absolutely no issue on liquidity side from the bank.

""We would appeal to customers that there is no need to worry about the safety of deposits. Only one-third of our customers have withdrawn Rs 50,000 during the moratorium. In fact, customers’ feedback is that they don't feel the need to withdraw money from the bank and we had higher inflows than outflows in the last few days,"" he added.

After taking the charge as MD and CEO, the main task for Prashant Kumar now would be to retain depositors and bring back the ones who departed from the bank, even though RBI governor Shaktikanta Das and Rajnish Kumar of SBI have asserted that depositors should not worry about their money.

""RBI and SBI have given all assurance to depositors. But the job of Prashant Kumar looks difficult in terms of bringing deposits back which departed after the moratorium. I feel most of depositors might have gone to SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank or some other banks,"" JN Gupta, Former ED, SEBI told CNBC-TV18.

""The work culture of Yes Bank is professional. Hence, bringing back trust of depositors is important, though it is little bit easier due to brand image developed over the period of times,"" he said.

Experts have lauded both SBI and RBI for their efforts in saving the troubled bank.

""In the Indian history, the first time this kind of experiment has been seen to save the bank and the full credit goes to RBI and State Bank of India for their wholehearted efforts to reassure Yes Bank depositors. If this model works well and there is no more cash withdrawal, then it will be new kind of situation and deposits will stick to it,"" Dipan Mehta of Elixir Equities said.

""There are a lot of challenges in terms of shifting a bank process, but I hope everything will work smoothly,"" he added.

The SBI-led consortium of banks will collectively provide Rs 10,000 crore to keep Yes Bank afloat.

State Bank of India will invest Rs 6,050 crore against 605 shares of Rs 10 each, while ICICI Bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank and IDFC First Bank will pour in Rs 3,950 crore in the cash-starved private sector lender.

According to experts, Prashant Kumar will not only have to win back customers but also bring in fresh foreign investment.

""The rally in share price clearly reflected the news. Now the next trigger for the bank would be to bring foreign interest back, through QIP or any other instrument,"" Prakash Diwan, Market Expert told CNBC-TV18.

Yes Bank shares rallied 134 percent in last three consecutive sessions to close at Rs 58.65 on March 17. It has rallied 957 percent from its record low of Rs 5.55 touched on March 6."

He informed them that the bank will resume full services starting 6 pm on March 18.

""Further to our email dated, March 10, we are happy to apprise you that Yes Bank will resume full banking services from 18:00 hours IST on Wednesday, March 18. We invite you to any of our 1,132 branches across India from March 19, post commencement of banking hours to experience our full suite of services,"" Prashant Kumar, Yes Bank administrator and the next MD and CEO of the bank's newly constituted board, told depositors in a letter.

On March 16, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reassured depositors with regard to the safety of their deposits. He told customers that if need be, RBI is ready to provide additional capital support to Yes Bank.

Keeping customers at the core, the bank has been able to resume services within an expeditious timeframe under RBI's guidance and direction. With the backing of the State Bank of India (SBI), India’s largest public sector bank, and private sector banks, Yes Bank stands recapitalised with reinforced liquidity and highest standards of ethics and governance.""

On March 16, Yes Bank approved the reconstitution plan, appointing Prashant Kumar, the current RBI-appointed administrator, as CEO and MD."

On March 16, the board of directors of the crisis-hit private sector lender approved the reconstitution of its board, announcing the appointment of Prashant Kumar, the current administrator, to the post of the chief executive officer and managing director of Yes Bank.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das also on March 16 reassured depositors of Yes Bank, emphasising that the revival plan chalked out for the bank is credible. He said, if need be, the central bank will provide additional capital support to the private lender.

Amid the ongoing crisis, ratings agencies have also been reassessing their outlook on the bank. Moody's, on March 16 upgraded the ratings of Yes Bank with a positive outlook while Japanese brokerage firm Nomura has suspended the coverage of Yes Bank, saying the private lender was damaged beyond repair."
yes bank,17-03-2020,RBL Bank keeps guidance intact on strong liquidity position,"After the Reserve Bank of India implemented moratorium for Yes Bank on March 6, stocks of Yes Bank and RBL Bank saw heavy selling pressure.

RBL Bank has crashed 46 percent since March 6, but gained some strength today, rising 7 percent intraday after the management said it is confident about its deposit levels, liquidity positions, and guidance.

""After moratorium on Yes Bank and problems with certain private banks, there was some problem related to deposits but we have been maintaining surplus liquidity positions. We previously announced that we have higher level of LCR, other line of credits, hence we always in a comfortable position,"" Vishwavir Ahuja, MD & CEO at RBL Bank told CNBC-TV18.

On the institutional front, there was some pulling out money which was across all banks, but RBI reached out to them saying they should not do that, he said.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said on March 16 there is sufficient liquidity in the financial markets and the RBI has been watching the situation closely.

As of yesterday, Ahuja said the trend seems to have kind of reversed in terms of deposits and the bank has not seen any withdrawal on Monday. ""Retail deposits base has been well, net inflow remains significant in retail and institutional desks. As we are extremely comfortable on the liquidity front, the withdrawal happened recently was not material for us.""

""Some institutional players wanted to play safe and as a result, they moved some money for one or two days but they are coming back again. In effect, we are net gainer, six very marquee names moved their corporate cash management to us and in few other cases, where fintech involved, accounts moved to us,"" he said.

Ahuja further said, ""Those banks which have the capability in terms of all segments, we are one of them now. I am trying to dispel all those concerns very directly.""

On top of that, he confidently said all financial parameters are strong, whether it is capital adequacy ratio, asset quality, etc. ""In fact, all growth engines have been running smoothly.""

Every bank has state governments' deposits. He said RBL Bank has around 6-7 percent of total deposits from state governments, which is not significant but some states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, etc are happy with the bank.

It is a global situation, the bank is not seeing anything immediate in terms of impact, he added.

Globally there has been market rout due to wide-spreading coronavirus outside of China. Hence to support the growth engine, several central banks including the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, etc announced interest rate cut as well as fiscal stimulus. In fact, they don't want any impact on their financial system.

The Reserve Bank of India approached several banks to provide financial assistance to Yes Bank. ""We have also been approached to invest in Yes Bank, but we felt that let the opportunity pass,"" Ahuja said.

Private banks and financial institutions HDFC, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, IDFC First Bank and Federal Bank invested Rs 3,950 crore in Yes Bank, while the leader State Bank of India invested Rs 6,050 crore. Hence, Rs 10,000 crore of liquidity support to the cash-starved Yes Bank which clearly reflected in the stock price that gained more than 150 percent in the last three consecutive sessions.

On the guidance front, RBL Bank's Ahuja said asset quality will remain stable and whatever the bank guided for Q4, it continued to standby.

""Slippages have been coming down, corporate slippages are within the guidance levels. We are confident to balance the tail-end of problems. In fact we are hopeful to embark on business as usual in FY21. We are will touch 3 million cards by end of this fiscal, which is one third the size of SBI Cards. Microlending business was good in February and also good in March so far. Retail business is tacking well,"" he explained.

On the margin front, Ahuja said actually margins are looking good now or maybe better than last quarter."

yes bank,16-03-2020,Moody's upgrades Yes Bank rating by a notch; outlook positive,"Acting quickly on the fast evolving capital position under the RBI-mandated restructuring of Yes Bank, rating agency Moody's on Monday upgraded its ratings with a positive outlook. Earlier in the day, Yes Bank announced that seven banks led by SBI have invested Rs 10,000 crore, boosting its core capital,

Later, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said if need be the central bank would give additional capital support to the crippled lender.

The central bank had superseded Yes Bank board on April 5 and placed it under an administrator.

""We today upgraded Yes Bank long-term foreign currency issuer and foreign currency senior unsecured MTN programme ratings to Caa1 from Caa3 and (P)Caa1 from (P)Caa3 respectively,"" Moody's Investors Service said in a late evening statement.

Accordingly, the credit outlook has also been changed to positive from negative.

yes bank,16-03-2020,"No surprise rate cut, but RBI appears ready to ensure financial stability; highlights of today's presser","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held a press conference on March 16 wherein the central bank avoided a surprise rate cut and remained focussed on Yes Bank and the impact of coronavirus on the economy.

""We will mainly focus on 2 issues - Yes Bank and certain aspects related to the fallout of coronavirus and its impact on the economy,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said.

There was an expectation of a possible emergency rate cut, ahead of the central bank's monetary policy review scheduled to be held from March 31 to April 3.

The expectations of a rate cut were stronger as central banks across the world have affected rate cuts to provide liquidity to their respective economies, the latest one being the US Federal Reserve which slashed interest rates earlier today.

Here are the top five highlights of the RBI's press conference:

Moratorium on Yes Bank to be lifted: The moratorium on Yes Bank will be lifted on March 18 at 6 pm and a new board will assume the position on March 26 and administrator will vacate office, said the central bank's governor.

""This time, the identity of the bank in difficulty, which is Yes Bank, is retained. If required, RBI will support Yes Bank with respect to liquidity. I would like to assure depositors their money is completely safe and there is no need for worry. In the history of Indian banking, depositors of SCBs have never lost money. After 6 pm on March 18, they can withdraw their money but there is no need for panic withdrawal,"" Das said.

Analysts expect RBI's assurance on Yes Bank will be a major relief for private sector bank depositors.

""RBI has reiterated its support for the revival of Yes Bank, the plan for which has been finalised by both the regulator and government with an upfront equity infusion of Rs 10,000 crore from a group of public and private sector banks led by RBI. Hopefully, this will arrest any large scale withdrawals of deposits once the moratorium on the bank is lifted and prevent any panic among private sector bank depositors,"" said Suman Chowdhury, President – Ratings at Acuité Ratings & Research.

Liquidity measures: In light of coronavirus outbreak, Das said RBI had been taking some calibrated measures to ensure financial markets and institutions remain sound and resilient.

""The RBI has several instruments at its command and stands ready to take all necessary measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the Indian economy,"" Das said.

Aimed at infusing more liquidity in the financial system, the central bank proposed to conduct another 6 months US dollar/rupee sell-buy swap on March 23.

To conduct LTRO: RBI will conduct LTRO (long-term repo operation) in multiple tranches up to a total amount of Rs 1 lakh crore at the policy rate. This will be followed by a review of the performance of LTRO.

Jayesh Mehta, India Treasurer at Bank of America is of the view that the extra LTRO may not have an immediate impact on yield curve like last time.

A rate cut in the offing: Rate decision will be taken in the MPC meeting, RBI said, hinting that there is a possibility of a cut.

""I'm not ruling out any possibility on the rate cut. We are estimating the impact of Covid-19 and we will give our growth estimates in MPC. India is relatively insulated from the global value chain, but there will be some impact,"" Das said.

Industry experts are of the view that ensuring liquidity is more important at this juncture than the rate cut.

""Don’t think we’re in a situation where a rate cut is warranted right away. Ensuring liquidity is more critical than cutting rates at this moment,"" said Keki Mistry, HDFC VC and CEO.

""With the Federal Reserve slashing the rates to a near-zero percent, there was pressure on the RBI to join the league by cutting the interest rates. Instead of going for a rate cut, RBI chose to conduct LTRO worth Rs 1 lakh crore to inject liquidity in the market. It is anticipated that the RBI will cut the rates in the next MPC meeting scheduled in April. However, in the current scenario, the monetary stimulus will only have a limited impact on the economy,"" said Deepthi Mary Mathew, Economist at Geojit Financial Services.

An attempt to calm the nerves: In his press conference, governor Das clearly indicated that the central bank is ready to take steps that will ensure the smooth functioning and stability of the country's financial system.

From liquidity measures to hinting at a rate cut, the RBI signalled that it is ready with tools to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on the economy.

""RBI Governor's assurance that the central bank will do whatever it takes is a great reassurance during these difficult times. Announcement of Rs 1 lakh LTRO will certainly take care of liquidity needs. India is in a strong position since we have plenty of room to cut rates, if necessary. Governor's assurance regarding deposits in private banks is timely,"" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services."
yes bank,16-03-2020,Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor's ED remand extended until March 20,"A special court here on Monday extended till March 20, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody of Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor, arrested on money laundering charges.

The former MD and CEO of the private lender was arrested by the ED here on March 8 under provisions of the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe related to the crisis at Yes Bank which has been placed under moratorium by the RBI.

The 62-year-old banker was initially remanded in the ED custody till March 11 which was later extended up to March 16.

As his remand ended on Monday, Kapoor was produced before special PMLA court judge P P Rajvaidya, who extended his ED custody till March 20 on a plea by the central investigating agency.

Meanwhile, Kapoor told the court he has been suffering for long from asthma and also depression.

""I just want to bring to your (court) notice that my family is providing treatment, but don't known when it will erupt,"" the veteran banker added.

The ED told the court that during Kapoor's tenure at Yes Bank, he had sanctioned Rs 202.10 crore loan to a joint venture involving the HDIL group.

A part of this loan was used by the real estate group to pay previous loans of Yes Bank, the agency said.

Earlier, the ED had saidloans worth Rs 30,000 crore were given to various entities when Kapoor was on the bank's panel.

""Of this, Rs 20,000 crore turned into bad debts,"" the agency had told the court.

The Reserve Bank of India had earlier thismonth imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account, and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

The ED has accused Rana, his family members and others of laundering proceeds of crime worth Rs 4,300 crore by receiving alleged kickbacks in lieu of extending big loans through their bank that later turned NPA."
yes bank,16-03-2020,"Nomura suspends Yes Bank coverage, says damage beyond repair","Japanese brokerage firm Nomura has suspended the coverage of Yes Bank, saying the private lender was damaged beyond repair.

Though the government took over the bank to prevent a collapse and the Reserve Bank of India has come with a restructuring plan for the lender, Nomura seems unimpressed.

""While Yes Bank's going concern risk is now minimised post RBI's restructuring plan (Rs 10,000 crore of capital infusion by banks), in our view the bank is damaged beyond repair to fundamentally evaluate any business/investment case,"" the brokerage said.

Nomura says Yes Bank will remain on life support for a long time and is clearly not out of the woods, given the +10x dilution by FY21F (5x in phase-1 of the restructuring plan), significant deterioration operationally, permanent damage to its liability profile, 75 percent of shares held locked in for three years and weak capital levels (CET-1 of 7.6% post planned infusion) as well as impending stress that was yet be recognised.

Hence, the brokerage suspended its coverage of the stock.

The country's fourth largest private sector lender on March 14 reported a loss of Rs 18,564 crore in the quarter ended December 2019 compared with the profit of Rs 1,001.8 crore a year ago, dented by significant rise in bad loans and severe fall in deposit base.

It reported an operational loss of Rs 6.42 crore in Q3FY20, impacted by slippages of Rs 24,600 crore – NIMs compressed by 190bp QoQ to 1.4 percent. The bank's liability profile deteriorated sharply, with deposit book shrinking by Rs 44,000 crore QoQ and loan book by 17 percent QoQ (24 percent YoY).

""Deposit run-down will continue especially post- moratorium and with smaller balance size and lower opex levers, we expect operating profitability to be dramatically impacted,"" said the brokerage.

Asset quality also deteriorated sharply, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) inching to 18.9 percent led by Rs 24,600 crore of slippages.

The bank did further guide towards an additional 5 percent slippages (Rs 9,000 crore) in FY21F (total GNPA of Rs 50,000 crore) against a total stress book of around Rs 75,000 crore.

""While the bank did ramp up its provision cover to 73 percent but with balance-sheet size shrinking, the left-over book will remain highly toxic, making any recovery in profitability very difficult, in our view,"" Nomura said.

With a loss of over Rs 18,000 crore, CET-1 was reduced to 0.6 percent and despite Rs 10,000 crore of capital infusion by banks as well as Rs 8,400 crore of AT-1 write down, CET-1 of 7.6 percent was weak and would require continued capital support, the brokerage said.

""We have seen no private interest so far in the bank and given the deterioration in the business, banks/RBI will have to continue to provide both liquidity and capital to the bank,"" it said.

Yes Bank expects pressures from sour loans, which led it to declare the highest loss for the December quarter, to continue even in FY21, but CEO-designate Prashant Kumar is confident of its survival after a Rs 10,000-crore capital infusion.

State Bank of India is ready to invest Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank, while ICICI bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bandhan Bank, Axis Bank and Federal Bank will put in Rs 3,700 crore in the cash-starved lender.

The moratorium period, which started on March 6, ends mid week and the new board will be formed within seven days.

Prabhudas Lilladher also suspended its rating on the stock after the third quarter loss. ""Deposit outflow behaviour post moratorium lifting will be important event and with statutory ratios below prescribed levels it is difficult to project any direction. Rating suspended,"" it said.

The brokerage also said though the bank had got fresh capital from other banks of Rs 10,000 crore under the reconstruction scheme but it wasn’t enough.

""The bank will need further capital infusions as some part of loans are still stressed and shrinkage in balance sheet will not keep operating profit at pace, but good part is most of the pain has been recognized with strong 72 percent PCR and hence we may see other investors support as well,"" it added.

Kumar was the former chief financial officer and deputy managing director of the State Bank of India (SBI).

The board of directors of Yes Bank has been reconstituted, with Sunil Mehta, former non-executive Chairman of Punjab National Bank, as the non-executive chairman, the bank informed the exchanges via a release. Mahesh Krishnamurthy and Atul Bheda have been appointed to the post of non-executive directors of the bank.

SBI will have the right to nominate two directors to the board of Yes Bank. The newly-constituted board will take effect immediately after the expiry of seven calendar days from the date of cessation of the moratorium, the release noted.

The moratorium on Yes Bank will be lifted starting 6 pm on March 18. The bank said, earlier today, that it will resume its full range of services starting March 19."
yes bank,16-03-2020,Lessons from the Yes Bank saga: Eternal vigilance is the price of financial stability,"VK Vijayakumar

Yes Bank’s restructuring plan involving the capital infusion of Rs 7,250 crore by SBI, Rs 1,000 crore, each, by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, Rs 600 crore by Axis Bank and Rs 500 crore by Kotak Bank has come as a big relief.

Many more institutions have shown willingness to invest. The restructuring plan involving the country’s leading banks will go a long way in instilling confidence in the embattled Yes bank. However, there is a risk that depositors might flee once the caps on withdrawals are lifted. Bulk depositors should be persuaded to stay.

The restructuring of Yes Bank has to be seen in the light of failures of the NBFCs, IL&FS and DHFL and the crisis in banks like PMC Bank and PNB. It is also important to recognise the fact that during the last eight years, the government has recapitalised India’s PSU banks to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh crore at the taxpayers’ expense. Aren’t we paying too high a price for financial failures? Who all are responsible? What lessons can we learn? These are the relevant questions.

The fact that the health of the financial system is crucial for economic growth and development needs no emphasis. Financial history is filled with examples of failures of financial institutions wreaking havoc in the real economy. That's why we have institutions for regulation and supervision, credit rating, auditing and many norms and guidelines for healthy practices. India has adopted most of these best practices. In spite of all these, why did Yes Bank fail?

What led to the crisis?

There have been serious lapses at many levels - in regulation and supervision, in auditing and in the functioning of the board. It is surprising that the abnormally high credit growth of Yes Bank relative to the growth of the industry, and the increasingly high proportion of fee income, particularly from new corporate borrowers, had escaped the attention of regulators for long. If a bank with a capital adequacy of 16.5 percent and gross NPAs of only 3.22 percent as late as March 2019, fail within a year, questions have to be raised on the quality of auditing and supervision. The Q3 FY20 loss of 18,564.2 crore, against a profit of Rs 1,000 crore during the corresponding period last year, is a reflection of failures at all levels.

Guilty should not go scot-free

Unfortunately, our experience is that financial manipulators go scot-free. This should change. A lapse in the Yes Bank episode is that Rana Kapoor could sell his stake in the bank even after he was shown the door. Many murky stories involving the promoters and the new breed of corporate borrowers are coming to light. All sorts of nexus have to be enquired and the guilty punished expeditiously. Regulators, auditors, independent directors and rating agencies have to be pro-active to pre-empt crisis. The stability of the financial system demands eternal vigilance.

yes bank,16-03-2020,Yes Bank: ED summons Anil Ambani,"Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani has been summoned by the ED in connection with its money laundering probe against Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and others, officials said on Monday.

They said Ambani was asked to depose at the Enforcement Directorate office in Mumbai on Monday as his group companies are among the big entities whose loans went bad after borrowing from the crisis-hit bank.

The officials said Ambani, 60, has sought exemption from appearance on some personal grounds and he may be issued a new date.

Ambani's group companies are stated to have taken loans of about Rs 12,800 crore from the bank that turned NPAs.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in a March 6 press conference that the Anil Ambani Group, Essel, ILFS, DHFL and Vodafone were among the stressed corporates Yes Bank had exposure to.

Officials said promoters of all the big companies who had taken large loans from the beleaguered bank which later turned bad are being summoned for questioning in the case to take investigation forward.

Ambani's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) upon deposition, they said.

Kapoor, 62, is at present in ED custody after he was arrested by the central probe agency early this month.

The ED has accused Kapoor, his family members and others of laundering ""proceeds of crime"" worth Rs 4,300 crore by receiving alleged kickbacks in lieu of extending big loans through their bank that later turned NPA."

AT1 securities are a type of contingent convertible bonds designed after the financial crisis to try to ensure that investors would be on the hook if a bank runs into financial stress.

“There is a possibility of this impacting the capital raising plans of other banks. Also, those holding these bonds could go for a risk reassessment leading to a rush to sell off these bonds resulting in a price fall,” said SV Sastry, MD and CEO, SBI DFHI.

After the Yes Bank reconstruction scheme was notified by the government, there was a confusion in the market on March 14 on whether these bonds will be honoured or extinguished as said in the draft reconstruction scheme made public by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). But, Yes Bank’s RBI-appointed administrator, Prashant Kumar clarified that these bonds will be written down fully, as per the agreed reconstruction scheme.

This is because the reconstruction scheme was formed after the RBI invoked Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which arises when the bank is deemed to be non-viable or approaching non-viability, enabling the write-down of certain Basel III AT1 Bonds.

“In light of the above provisions of the Basel III Circular, the Perpetual Subordinated Basel III Compliant Additional Tier I Bonds issued by the Bank for an amount of Rs 3,000 crores on December 23, 2016 and the Perpetual Subordinated Basel III Compliant Additional Tier I Bonds issued by the Bank for an amount of Rs. 5,415 crores on October 18, 2017 have been fully written down and stand extinguished with immediate effect,” Kumar informed exchanges.

The total write down of AT1 bond portfolio will make capital raising tougher for the industry. After the Yes Bank write down of AT1 bonds, private sector lender, IndusInd Bank had deferred a board meeting which was scheduled to discuss raising capital through these bonds, blaming the “current market conditions” for the deferral and said it was sufficiently capitalised.

Legal battle

But the dust is unlikely to settle quickly. According to media reports, investors in these bonds have already started approaching courts for resolution.

Last week, Axis Trustee representing, bondholders of Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court seeking remedy against the Reserve Bank’s decision to extinguish these bonds.

The petitioners have argued that the total write down of AT1 bonds, treating these instruments below equity is not fair. Besides Axis Trustee, Larsen & Toubro has also moved the Bombay High Court separately against the AT1 bond write down decision.

Bondholders have invested a total of nearly Rs 94,000 crore in AT1 bonds issued by Indian banks, according to rating agency ICRA. AT1 bonds, also called perpetual bonds, are considered quasi-equity instruments and are riskier than Tier 1 bonds.

Misselling to retail investors?

Not only institutions, but also retail investors who will suffer on account of the AT1 bond write down.

Retail investors, though form only a minority among the institutional investors, too have reportedly approached the RBI seeking at least their principal amount back.

According to a report in the Financial Express, at least 70 bond holders have so far written to the RBI.

They have alleged that these bonds were sold to them without making them aware of the actual risk involved in these investments, hence being tantamount to misselling. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report."
yes bank,14-03-2020,"Yes Bank posts record Rs 18,564 crore loss for December quarter, NPAs over Rs 40,000 crore","Yes Bank, the beleaguered private lender which needed a government bailout to stay aloft, finally revealed an earnings scorecard — late in the night — which was as disastrous as was widely believed.

Losses soared significantly, deposit base wilted sharply and bad loans, or non-performing assets (NPAs) swelled drastically and its ability to absorb losses withered, all of which underscored why it was imperative for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to impose limits on withdrawals to prevent a run on deposits and launch a rescue act for the bank.

Yes Bank reported a loss of Rs 18,564 crore at the quarter ended December compared with a rise in profit of Rs 1001.8 crore a year ago, dragged down by a precipitous rise in bad loans and severe decline in deposit base, it said in a statement.

It posted a net loss of Rs 600.08 crore in the previous quarter.

The bank's gross NPAs shot up to 18.87 percent in the given quarter, as against 2.10 percent in the year-ago period and 7.39 percent in previous quarter.

Yes Bank's capital buffers plummeted to below regulatory mandates, its results revealed. The CET1 ratio (a measure of a bank's capacity to absorb potential losses) stood at 0.6 percent as against minimum requirement of 7.4 percent implying massive impairments.

Its net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, fell considerably by 60 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,064.78 crore, and the sequential decline was 51.23 percent.

Gross non performing assets (GNPA) stood at Rs 40,709 crore as against Rs 17,134 crore on a quarter-on-quarter basis and net NPAs were at 5.97 percent versus 4.35 percent.

The bank said it increased bad loans provisions to Rs 24,765 crore in the December quarter as against Rs 1,336 crore in the previous quarter.

A bank's mainstay, deposits, fell by Rs 44,000 crore. Yes Bank said, as on March 5, its deposits stood Rs 1.37 lakh crore, down from Rs 2.09 lakh crore.

The bank's operating loss for the quarter stood at Rs 6.42 crore, against profit of Rs 1,990.36 crore in the year-ago period, while the non-interest income (other income) dropped to Rs 625.66 crore in Q3FY20, from Rs 890.87 crore YoY.

The downbeat performance comes after the RBI rescue plan was followed by India's largest private banks, including State Bank Of India, joining hands to keep Yes aloft. Yes was billed as one of the brightest stars on the Indian banking horizon.

The 16-year old bank said it was “made aware” of anonymous whistleblower complaints against irregularities in operations and conflict of interest against former MD and CEO Rana Kapoor in September 2018. Authorities have launched investigations against Kapoor, who was detained and faces several charges, including a case of money laundering, registered against him

Yes said it conducted an internal enquiry supervised by its board and the report reviewed by Board in November 2018. The bank said it then engaged an external firm to independently examine the matter in December 2018. The bank received two reports since.

Much of Yes’ troubles seed from the reckless lending by Kappor, according to multiple banking analysts and experts Moneycontrol spoke to.

Earlier in the day, the central government appointed former SBI banker Prashant Kumar as the new Chief Executive Officer of the financially troubled Yes Bank.

Accordingly, the former Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Managing Director of State Bank of India (SBI) will take over his new responsibilities once the moratorium on the stressed lender is lifted on Wednesday, a Finance Ministry notification said.

At present, office of the Administrator appointed by the RBI has taken the charge of the bank till the date of moratorium cessation.

Apart from Kumar, Sunil Mehta, former Non-Executive Chairman of Punjab National Bank will take over as the Non-Executive Chairman of Yes Bank.

Other board members include Mahesh Krishnamurthy and Atul Bheda, both as Non-Executive Directors.

yes bank,14-03-2020,"Yes Bank's Rs 3,700cr booster shot | Should one buy the stock now?","Yes Bank has rallied more than 300 percent after hitting a low of Rs 5.55 on March 6. The cash-strapped lender received a Rs 3,700 crore booster shot from five financial institutions along with State Bank of India (SBI). The move is likely to calm the frayed nerves of investors and depositors.

The Cabinet on March 13 approved Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020, with a higher authorised capital of Rs 6,200 crore as against Rs 5,000 crore as per RBI Draft Reconstruction Scheme 2020.

As per the contours of the scheme, ICICI Bank (Rs 1,000 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore) and HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore) will infuse Rs 3,700 crore as equity into the crisis-hit Yes Bank. State Bank of India will invest Rs 7,250 crore for up to 26 percent stake with a lock-in of three years as against the earlier envisaged 49 percent stake.

It also announced the lifting of the moratorium by 6 pm on March 18 (from April 3 earlier), the third working day after the reconstruction scheme comes into force.

So, has the private sector lender turned a corner and more importantly has become an investment play? Market experts don't think so. They cited asset quality concerns, which could play spoilsport in the future. At best, they see it as a good trading play.

“The current moratorium on deposit withdrawal and capital infusion are just the first steps toward the revival of Yes Bank,"" Emkay Global said in a recent report, maintaining its sell call on the private sector lender. The brokerage sees many more such steps for a 'sustainable long term revival' of the bank to 'survive and thrive independently'.

Ajit Mishra, V-P Research, Religare Broking, too echoed the concern raised by Emkay. Mishra went a step further and advises investors to 'avoid' investing, especially when there are 'a list of quality banking names available at a good bargain'.

yes bank,14-03-2020,"Yes Bank: Rescue plan takes effect, withdrawal limit to go in '3 working days'","The government notified a rescue plan for Yes Bank, led by State Bank of India (SBI) and joined by other lenders, as it looked to shield the banking sector from a widespread crisis.

yes bank,13-03-2020,Yes Bank crisis | Will there now be any takers for PSB privatisation?,"Yes Bank was the second failure of a new age private sector lender in the post-liberalisation era. After its collapse, there is a question mark on the future course of bank privatisation. The argument that private banks are more efficient than their state-run counterparts and private investors are guarantors of good corporate governance is open to debate.

Last week, the government approved a bail-out deal led by State Bank of India (SBI) after Yes Bank failed to raise survival capital. The bank collapsed after being hit by an alleged promoter fraud and careless lending. About two years ago, there was a similar quid-pro-case in ICICI Bank too.

Yes Bank has been trying to raise at least Rs 10,000 crore from prospective investors for months, but failed to do so. The bank’s stressed asset levels, estimated anywhere between Rs 30,000 crore and Rs 55,000 crore, and a series of corporate governance issues, repelled investors.

Rana Kapoor, the bank’s co-founder and promoter, is being investigated on charges of accepting 'kickbacks' against Yes Bank loans. The case has parallels with the 2018 ICICI Bank case with respect to a dubious loan deal involving Chanda Kochhar and Videocon Group’s Venugopal Dhoot.

“There is a case for a re-look (at the privatisation agenda),” said a former executive director of IDBI Bank.

Pros and cons

There is a long standing clamour for privatisation of PSU banks from experts. Nearly 60 percent of assets in the Indian banking system is still under the control of state-run banks, leading to indirect government control over their operations.

When the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014, the Prime Minister’s statement that ‘government has no business to be in business’ was seen as a precursor to the privatisation drive. But this promise has largely remained on the paper.

The consolidation exercise has been confined to mergers among weak state-run banks (the government, last year, merged 10 public sector banks in one go into four to build size) and Life Insurance Corporation of India’s takeover of bad loan ridden IDBI Bank early last year.

Those arguing in favour of privatisation have always pointed at the efficient running of private banks vis-à-vis their public peers and better professional management.

""PSB reforms remain very important,"" said Arundhati Bhattacharya, former Chairman of SBI when asked whether PSB privatisation should be re-looked at in the context of the Yes Bank crisis.

In May 2014, an RBI-appointed panel had recommended privatisation of PSBs and governance reforms. The panel, headed by former Axis Bank Chairman PJ Nayak had suggested privatisation, citing the low productivity and asset quality issues of state-run banks.

""The government should trim its holding in banks to less than 50 percent to make sure a level-playing field for state-run banks on vigilance enforcement, employee compensation and the applicability of the right to information,"" the panel said.

When the panel's recommendations came out, total gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of banking system was Rs 2.4 lakh crore. This chunk has swelled to Rs 9 lakh crore as of December 2019. The ratio of PSU bank NPAs to total bad loan stock has remained at a much higher level compared with private banks.

At the end of December, about 80 percent of bank NPAs are on the books of state-run banks. The government’s burden on capitalising PSU banks ever year has been immense. At this juncture, there is Rs 7.16 lakh crore NPAs on PSB books, while the same for private banks stands at Rs 1.81 lakh crore.

As per Economic Survey 2020, the government has invested Rs 430,000 crore in PSU banks. “In 2019, every rupee of taxpayer money invested in PSBs, on average, lost 23 paise. In contrast, every rupee of investor money invested in 'new private banks' (NPBs) — licensed after India’s 1991 liberalisation — on average gained 9.6 paise.”

The Yes Bank episode raises a big question mark on this assumption.

Not every bank is a Yes Bank

Banking sector experts told Moneycontrol that bad events in one or two private banks do not make the idea of privatisation totally redundant. “The failure of governance in some private banks does not mean that privatisation on PSBs is a bad idea because we all know that they have too much government interference (there are arguments to say that if the government is the owner it can intervene) and governance systems are weak,” said Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, at CARE Ratings.

But former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan was of the view that privatisation alone won’t solve the problems of the sector, saying that even private lenders are not immune to the problem of bad assets in a slowing economy. This is true if one looks at the latest NPA figures of leading private banks. In Q3, most private lenders had reported a spike in their NPA levels hit by a slowing economy.

Experts point out examples of well-run private sector banks that have consistently performed better than PSBs. “In terms of performance indicators, private banks have fared better than PSBs. But then when we talk of privatisation, it has to be a complete release of the government and PSBs being allowed to work on their own in terms of people, compensation, decisions, etc. Partial disinvestment just to earn revenue or increase capital is not the answer,” Sabnavis said.

Bank privatisation, as the Nayak panel proposed, has long-term merits. But the corporate governance mess at Yes Bank and ICICI Bank show that merely changing ownership to private hands may not be enough to improve efficiency in the operations of state-run banks. These banks will require fundamental governance reforms and well laid out regulations to adhere to good corporate governance practices."

FM Sitharaman said that the State Bank of India (SBI) will invest 49 percent of equity in Yes Bank, adding that other investors are also being invited.

The State Bank of India (SBI)will have a lock-in period of three years for up to only 26 percent of the 49 percent of its stake in Yes Bank. For the rest of the investors, the three-year lock-in will be applicable for 75 percent of their investment in the private lender.

They are adjusting their portfolios and are selling what can be sold, said Ridham Desai, head of India equity research & India equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.

High quality stocks are falling and are getting hit the most because they are the ones that can be sold the most, he added.

""Domestic investors have put a lot of cash to work; a month ago they had a fairly high cash balance and even though the February flows were strong I suspect a lot of that cash is now into the market. What they are looking at is whether they need to make changes in their allocations to reflect the pricing and the fundamental environment,"" he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

""We are now at levels where if somebody wants to engage in stocks with a 12-month view, the outcome will be good. Yes, there could be more downside in the next month or two months but if I look out 12 months, it will be good,"" added Desai.

According to him, it is difficult to call the bottom in our markets but must start deploying cash.

When asked about global demand and supply shock, Desai said: ""Nobody knows how bad this coronavirus spread can get. We have not yet figured how to cure this. What is happening right now is just a prevention. It’s coming a little late in several parts of the world and China showed the way several days ago that you have to aggressively quarantine people and stop the spread.""

On the Yes Bank front, he mentioned that the action on Yes Bank is a welcome step and policy makers have done a good job.

""I think the financing for NBFCs, which had frozen and available only for the top rates NBFCs, will open up a bit and they will get much better liquidity conditions. This would have happened in ordinary circumstance but spreading of the virus has masked the positive actions around Yes Bank and the financial system,"" he further added.

Speaking about specific sectors, he said that a lot of good quality businesses are trading at very attractive levels.

""I am certainly avoiding global exposures right now. The virus brings greater global growth risk than domestic growth risk. So it’s possible that India’s own growth rate outperforms the world and therefore, global materials or IT are businesses that could be avoided for now until the dust settles especially on the Western hemisphere,"" Desai added.

yes bank,13-03-2020,Yes Bank rebounds amid reports of Cabinet clearing Draft Resolution Scheme,"Shares of Yes Bank rebounded 10 percent intraday amid reports that Cabinet approved the Draft Resolution Scheme for the bank on March 13. The recovery was seen after a 15 percent fall in opening.

The stock in previous session corrected 13 percent after rallying 78 percent in two consecutive sessions earlier. It was quoting at Rs 25.70, up Rs 0.65, or 2.59 percent on the BSE at 1216 hours IST.

State Bank of India also rallied 13.5 percent intraday, and was up 10.67 percent at Rs 235.45 at 1216 hours IST.

Unnamed sources told CNBC-TV18 that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs today has cleared the Draft Resolution Scheme for Yes Bank, the country's fourth largest private sector lender.

The stock had fallen 57 percent on last Friday, but after the assurance from State Bank of India over the weekend, saying the depositors should not be worried about deposits and it will be there with Yes Bank for next three years, investors/traders gained confidence and started buying the stock in huge quantity on Monday and Wednesday this week.

Country's largest lender SBI on Thursday said it would invest Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank and was not interested to buy more than 49 percent stake in the bank. The amount was higher than what it earlier said.

Over the last weekend, Rajnish Kumar, Chairman of SBI said they would invest Rs 2,450 crore initially in Yes Bank and that can be increased up to Rs 10,000 crore over the next three years, but recent media reports suggested that the lender is looking for investors to infuse around Rs 20,000 crore to support Yes Bank which faced liquidity shortage.

On last Thursday evening, RBI suddenly has taken control of Yes Bank and put it under moratorium till April 3 as Yes Bank under Ravneet Gill even after multiple attempts failed to raise Rs 14,000 crore from the markets in last one year.

Earlier in the week, Prashant Kumar, the administrator for Yes Bank appointed by Yes Bank, clearly indicated that they will try their best to get Yes Bank out of moratorium period much before the deadline of April 3 and said things would be more clearer by Saturday, March 14.

Yes Bank will announce its earnings for October-December quarter 2019 on March 14, which will give the clear idea not only to State Bank of India but also other investors about the financial position of Yes Bank.

Meanwhile, Bandhan Bank will replace Yes Bank in the Bank Nifty index with effect from March 27."
yes bank,13-03-2020,How the Yes Bank crisis has caused a domino effect,"Gaurav Garg

Masses were only reviving and starting to gain their faith in the financial system of the country when we witnessed yet another setback, this time to the banking segment of the nation. Private banking player Yes Bank, which once had a dominant position in the country saw its NPAs climbing fast with the bank’s primary lenders currently undergoing steep valuation declines or started undergoing an investigation itself.

The resultant cash crunch was responsible for the trickle-down effect that not only affected the direct account holders but had an impact on various other fronts as well.

The first and foremost effect of the Yes Bank crisis was on Life Insurance Corporation of India. The insurer has usually seen a high amount of revenue collection coming in the month of March every year. The premiums usually flow in these days as online payments. With the automation of processes, the bank for NACH debit and cheque clearances for LIC was Yes Bank which is expected to affect the collections for the corporation for the month of March for Q4 ‘20.

LIC had also earlier sent a message stating there would be a delay in premium debit for policies. This would add to the distress that the crisis has already been causing.

Another impact is on the account holders as the bank is under a moratorium restricting the monthly withdrawal to Rs 50,000, subject to certain exceptions and prior approvals from RBI. This is not only bound to hinder the day to day activities for people whose, primary bank accounts were in yes Bank, but may also hamper small businesses.

Not only would this affect the daily lifestyle, but it may also demotivate the people who wanted to apply for the SBI Card IPO. Out of all the applications for allotments received for the IPO, applications worth Rs 1,500 crore were through people with their accounts in Yes Bank.

Even though the company said that if the applicants are able to pay the amount through an alternative bank account the allotment would still be done, this may not be a practically feasible option for many in such a short notice. Thus, the crisis is expected to have its effects on the IPO too, affecting the listing price and number of participants to a huge extent.

On the other side however, one should also keep in mind that a good participation even if after the effects of the crisis, may help Yes Bank in the long run. This can be said based on the fact that SBI would be infusing capital in the beleaguered bank soon, taking a 49 percent stake as a part of restructuring scheme that has been proposed. The collections of the IPO would thus help SBI fund this move too. However, whether each process would be executed successfully is based upon the IPO’s performance in the current bearish markets.

Altico Capital has liabilities of about Rs 4,300 crore including term loans, non-convertible debenture (NCD) dues to lenders like Yes Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, and others.

Altico is backed by Clearwater Capital Partners, Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Varde Partners.

The beleaguered real-estate lender defaulted on Rs 20 crore ECB repayment to Mashreq Bank last year, which led to a few lenders recalling loans.

Thereafter, lenders formed a committee to execute a resolution plan for the NBFC under the RBI's June 7 circular by signing an Inter Creditor Agreement.

Altico's troubles follow a spate of defaults among Indian shadow banks."
yes bank,12-03-2020,Yes Bank crisis: Debenture trustee ATSL writes to RBI seeking relief for AT1 bondholders,"Axis Trustee Services (ATSL), a debenture trustee for majority AT1 bondholders of Yes Bank, on March 11 requested the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to consider salvaging at least around 20 percent of the bondholders outstanding principal amount.

""The majority bondholders of the AT1 Bonds, for which ATSL is acting as a debenture trustee, have suggested that a minimum of 170 crore shares be allotted to the existing AT1 holders in proportion to their current holding of these bonds,"" ATSL said in the letter to the central bank.

In the restructuring package for Yes Bank proposed last week, the RBI had suggested that over Rs 8,000 crore worth of investments by MFs and bank treasuries in the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds should be written-off completely.

Following this, ATSL had approached the Bombay High Court challenging RBI's proposal. The bondholders represented by ATSL requested the central bank to reinstate the principle of inherent seniority of AT1 bonds as an asset class over equity shareholders.

""An imputed value of Rs 10 per share would be approximately Rs 1,700 crores, salvaging near-about 20% of the principal outstanding,"" the letter noted.

It added that the allocation is in lieu of existing AT1 holding, hence will not entail any fresh investments by AT1 holders and will be allotted against the write-down of the bonds.

The letter further mentioned that ""the bondholders have requested that the lock-in features if any should be restricted up to 36 months in line with the proposed new equity issuance of the issuing bank.""

ATSL said that provided the conditions it has mentioned in the letter are acceptable to the RBI, its majority AT1 bondholders shall not pursue any further legal recourse and that ATSL would also withdraw its current petition."
yes bank,12-03-2020,"Yes Bank: RBI may claw back ESOPs, bonuses for top management","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is reportedly looking at clawing back employee stock options (ESOPs) and bonuses issued to “top management” of troubled private lender Yes Bank. The aim is to shake out and find their role i f information about the trouble was suppressed deliberately or under pressure, the Business Standard reported.

The first step would apparently be sifting through those categorised as the top management at Yes Bank, an anomaly in private banks and saw sharp shifts over the years. The bank’s top management presently includes over 100 people in roles of presidents, senior presidents, group presidents etc.

The development sends strong signals that the regulator will keep keen eyes on pay-outs to the top management of private banks and that FY20 books would be “under intense scrutiny” and is a wake-up call to whistleblowers, the paper added.

This would be the first case of the RBI’s November 4, 2019 guidelines on the compensation of the banks' whole-time directors, chief executive officers and control staff. It is to be seen if the call would be given after the RBI’s Board of Financial Supervision meeting in March-end.

The November circular modified a circular issued on January 13, 2012; and stated that stipulations would set in from April 1, 2020, while prior slip-ups would be subject to clawbacks or malus. The circular does not specify that these measures would also apply to MDs and CEOs.

If invoked, the clawback would be as impactful as the Banking Regulation (BR) Act’s Section 35A – which empowers the RBI “to examine on oath any director or other officer (or employee) of the banking company in relation to its business”. This particular provision has never been invoked."
yes bank,12-03-2020,AMFI writes to RBI on Yes Bank AT1 bonds; tries to negotiate on behalf of MFs,"With the Yes Bank crisis threatening to singe several mutual fund houses due to the write down of AT1 bonds of the private lender, the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) wants equity and preference shares to be marked down before AT1 bond investments.

""We have written to RBI and said that first equity shareholders, then preference shareholders and then AT1 bondholders should be asked to mark down the value permanently,"" said NS Venkatesh, Chief Executive Officer, AMFI.

A copy of this letter has also been sent to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

The letter to RBI also pointed out that the perpetual bond market will dry up and yields will be affected.

AMFI has decided to write the letter to RBI as 11 mutual fund houses have nearly Rs 3,000 crore invested in AT1 bonds of Yes Bank and AMCs may stand to lose their money if RBI’s draft rescue plan is approved.

As per data sourced from Morningstar India, in all, 11 fund houses had exposure worth Rs 2,819 crore via 30 schemes as on Jan 31, 2020.

""The instruments qualifying as Additional Tier 1 capital, issued by Yes Bank Ltd under Basel III framework, shall stand written down permanently, in full, with effect from the appointed date. This is in conformity with the extant regulations issued by Reserve Bank of India based on the Basel framework."" said the RBI's draft plan.

Almost all fund houses have side-pocketed their exposures to Yes Bank bonds in a bid to prevent the distressed assets from damaging the returns generated from more liquid and better-performing assets.

A perpetual bond is a bond with no maturity date that is not redeemable but pays a steady stream of interest forever.

A reading of terms and conditions of AT1 Bonds for capital adequacy suggests that since bonds are perpetual in nature, these carry a fixed interest rate called coupon.

The issuer, in this case Yes Bank has a call option i.e. close the bond after 5 years.

However, before that period RBI has stepped into the management of Yes Bank, initially writing down the entire value of AT1 Bonds which MFs are now trying to rescue by negotiations with RBI.

""Bond holding by debt mutual funds was considered a safer option by many retail investors, generating higher returns than bank fixed deposits,"" said an ex-SEBI Officer who worked in its MF department."

owner Radhakishan Damani and PremjiInvest to join the Yes Bank rescue consortium.

Jhunjhunwala and Damani are among the many private investors tapped for the Yes Bank recapitalisation plan, The Times of India reported. While The Economic Times added that PremjiInvest is also on the rolls.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the reports.

The central bank is looking for the maximum number of investors are part of the consortium to ensure that no single entity/individual (other than the State Bank of India) holds more than 5 percent stake in the troubled bank, TOI reported.

The government is keen on involving private equity (PE) to keep the ‘nationalisation’ tag away from the Yes Bank rescue as most public sector banks (PSBs) are in capital conservation mode.

However, global P/E players have laid out important conditions, reports Business Standard. JC Flowers, Cerberus Capital, Tiden Park Capital and Blackstone want SBI to completely write-down Yes Bank’s Tier II bonds as part of the liability clean up.

As per the report, they want SBI to identify all stressed loan accounts and sell them to an asset reconstruction company (ARC). PEs are willing to invest up to $1.7 billion in Yes Bank but on similar terms that were offered to SBI, i.e. at Rs 10 per share.

The RBI proposed a revival plan for Yes Bank that will include initial capital infusion and funding lines to prevent a relapse once the 30-day moratorium imposed on March 5 is lifted. As per the plan, investors in additional Tier I (AT1) bonds have agreed to write-off 80 percent of their investment and convert 20 percent to equity, the TOI report said.

The central bank is expected to announce finalised commitments from SBI and other banks such as HDFC Group, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Group – who are in talks for equity investment - as soon as the banks confirm their investment.

As per the plan, once the announcement is made, banks will infuse Rs 20,000 crore as equity on day 2; public sector banks will invest around Rs 30,000 crore in certificates of deposits (CDs) of the bank on day 3; and the moratorium will be lifted on day 4, the TOI report stated.

The AT1 bondholders have Rs 8,500 crore investment Yes Bank, which will be converted into 170 crore equity shares with a face value Rs 10. This means an investment of Rs 1,700 crore with a three-year lock-in. The one sticky point would come from mutual fund houses (MFs) that hold AT1 bonds in pure debt funds as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) restricts equity investments by funds."
yes bank,12-03-2020,Moratorium on Yes Bank could have transitory impact on most corporates: Ind-Ra,"The moratorium on Yes Bank could have a transitory impact on most corporates exposed to the bank, and delays in resuming normal services may impact the near-term liquidity of some of its customers, rating agency Ind-Ra said.

""India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has carried out a first-cut assessment of the impact of the recently imposed moratorium on Yes Bank's...withdrawals till April 3, 2020. The disruption could be transitory for most corporates exposed to the bank, given the administrator's statement of resuming the fully operational status by next week,"" the rating agency said.

However, delays in resuming normal services could impact the near-term liquidity of some of the bank's customers.

Also, corporate groups with a large dependency on the bank could face a longer period of disruption.

These disruptions could stem from their usage of Yes Bank as a lender for facilities such as cash credit, letters of credit, bank guarantees and other working capital facilities as well as a term debt provider.

The moratorium is also likely to impact the liquidity cushion available with many corporates in the form of deposits and investments parked with Yes Bank or available unutilised lines.

Also, issuers with Yes Bank as a service provider could also see a severe impact on their day-to-day operations.

These are the issuers where Yes bank manages their trust and retention accounts and debt service reserve accounts, is counterparty for securitisation transactions or acts as a collection agent, among other services.

There could be a potential second-degree impact through unavailability of transaction channels such as point of sale, wallets and clearing facilities where Yes Bank is a third party. Similarly, for companies where the key supplier or key customer banks with Yes Bank, there could be a cascading impact.

Ind-Ra believes that the impact of the moratorium needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Companies sitting on a weak liquidity buffer along with large dependence on Yes Bank for fund-based working capital lines are likely to face near-term liquidity challenges.

Ind-Ra further said it expects large non-banking financial institutions to generally have a well-diversified funding mix and limited reliance on Yes Bank on their liability side. Also, most of these do not have any material deposits with the bank.

The impact on infrastructure projects is contingent on the level of involvement of Yes Bank in the daily operations.

Ind-Ra expects a higher risk in cases where the bank is closely linked and is the escrow banker (notwithstanding the number of banks in the consortium)."
yes bank,11-03-2020,"There was enough time to put together plan for Yes Bank, says Raghuram Rajan","Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on March 11 said there was a lot of time to put together a plan for Yes Bank which had given ""enough"" notice about the problems it was facing. Crisis-ridden Yes Bank was put under a moratorium last week, with the RBI capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account and superseding its board.

SBI is set to pick up 49 per cent stake in the lender under RBI's reconstruction plan.

""Yes Bank had given us enough notice that it has been in difficulty...so there was enough time to put together a plan.

""I hope what we have got is best available (plan), but I don't want to second guess, because I don't know the details,"" Rajan said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

Rajan, who completed his three-year term at the RBI in 2016, asserted that he has been saying for a long time now that there is a need to clean up the financial sector quickly and in a resolute way so that the country can move forward.

""Unwillingness to clean up has prolonged state of malaise in Indian economy...

""Clean up has to be undertaken on an emergency basis, otherwise sense of confidence which is needed in our NBFC, private banks and even in our state-owned banks that would be missing, that means financial sector cannot contribute to the growth,"" he said.

Rajan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, also stressed on making the balance sheets of financial institutions as clean as possible, fixing governance issues and recapitalising banks.

""So this is something we started in 2015, and it's 2020, 5 years is too long for it,"" he said.

To a question related to RBI's policy rate, Rajan said no amount of interest rate cut is going to help if credit growth is weak.

""Are companies willing to borrow and invest on the basis of lower interest rates... Unless we fix the financial system, it's like trying to send water through broken pipes. It's going to leak out all over the place,"" he said.

On when will India regain the economic growth rate of 6-7 per cent, Rajan said it will happen when the government takes appropriate action."
yes bank,11-03-2020,Equity investors should be first to take brunt in case of YES Bank: AMFI,"Equity investors should be the first to take the brunt in case of YES Bank's restructuring, followed by preference shareholders, and the additional tier-I bondholders should be the last to be touched, mutual fund industry body AMFI said on March 11.

The asset management companies have made representations to both SEBI and RBI regarding the same, lobby grouping AMFI's chief executive N S Venkatesh said.

In the restructuring package proposed last week, the RBI had suggested that over Rs 8,000 crore of investments by MFs and bank treasuries in the AT-1 bonds should be written-off completely, leading to the voices of concern being expressed by fund managers.

""We as an industry believe that first equity write-off should happen, then the preference shares has to happen and then only the AT-1 instruments should be written down. This is the thought process we have and which we have taken up with the appropriate authorities,"" Venkatesh told reporters here.

He added that representations have been made to both banking regulator RBI and capital markets watchdog SEBI regarding this.

Axis Trustee Services has already filed a petition with the Bombay High Court against the RBI proposals.

According to proponents of the move, the AT-1 bond holders are paid a premium of up to 1 percentage point on the coupon rate or the interest which they earn on such investments, because of the riskier nature.

Ratings agency ICRA has said that over Rs 93,000 crore of investor wealth is riding on such bonds which form a crucial part of the capital buffers for banks.

However, those raising concerns have been citing provisions wherein capital buffers have to dip below a particular threshold in order for an event to be recognised as a case of extreme stress on the bank, which justifies the write-offs.

YES Bank, which is set to report it earnings for the December quarter on March 7, had last disclosed that the common equity tier-I investments are at 8.7 percent as of September 2019.

YES Bank was put under moratorium last March 5 and has been placed under several restrictions, including capping depositor withdrawals at Rs 50,000 for a month. As part of the restructuring plan suggested a day later, equity holders are not facing any downside besides the prospect of reducing holding because of the plan to enlarge the capital base.

The announcement comes a day after its customers were allowed inward IMPS and NEFT services for the same purposes.

RTGS is used for payments of over Rs 2 lakh, while payments below this amount can be made using NEFT. Besides, loan and credit cards repayments to the bank can also be done through IMPS from other bank accounts.

""Inward RTGS services have been enabled. You can make payments towards YES BANK Credit Card dues and loan obligations from other bank accounts,"" the bank said in a tweet on Wednesday.

On March 5, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in consultation with the government put a moratorium on Yes Bank till April 3, citing serious financial mismanagement at the private sector lender. During the period, customers are not allowed to withdraw more than Rs 50,000.

The bank on Tuesday allowed inward IMPS and NEFT services to enable its customers to make payments towards Yes Bank credit card EMIs and loans through other bank accounts. The move came after its customers complained that they were not able to make payments towards their Yes Bank credit and loan repayments and were anxious about being levied a penalty for no fault of theirs.

Besides, within the limit of Rs 50,000, the Mumbai-headquartered lender has also allowed its customers to withdraw money from its own as well as other bank ATMs.

In the FAQs, on a query as to what will happen if someone has written and issued cheques to clients, Yes Bank responded, ""All clearing activities are suspended as of now as per the directive. Your cheques already issued will not be honoured till the clearing activities are restarted or further directive from regulator.""

On another query as to what will happen if someone has already dropped a cheque at Yes Bank counter, it said that as all the clearing activities are suspended, ""Yes Bank DD/cheques will not be presented in clearing till further instructions or till reinstatement of clearing activities.""

However, on a query what if an employer holds a current account with Yes Bank and needs to make withdrawal of more than Rs 50,000 to pay salaries to employees, the lender said it can be done.

""Yes Bank current account can be debited for more than Rs 50,000 towards disbursement of salaries in the accounts maintained with Yes Bank only,"" it clarified.

Further, it also said transfer from one Yes Bank account to another will be allowed without any restriction.

""However, customers can withdraw in a sum up to an aggregate of Rs 50,000 from all these accounts in the moratorium period till April 3, 2020,"" it added.

If one wishes to liquidate a standalone fixed deposit in Yes Bank, it said the branches can liquidate standalone fixed deposits (FDs) amounting less than Rs 20,000 along with interest and pay in cash as per process.

""For FDs equal to or above Rs 20,000 (along with interest) but less Rs 50,000 (along with interest), branches can issue demand draft (DD) to customers, however that DD can be presented for clearing only once the clearing services are re-instated,"" it said.

Since the bank was placed under the moratorium on March 5, a sense of panic gripped among customers across the country, who were seen queuing up at bank branches and ATMs to withdraw money.

Yes Bank said its ATMs are functional and customers can withdraw money from there.

Services such as digital payments supported by Yes Bank also faced outages in the initial stages, which now have been restored. Among others, prepaid meal and forex cards services are also affected due to the sudden oversight on the private sector lender.

During the moratorium period, Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

The RBI has initiated a draft reconstruction scheme for the private sector lender according to which State Bank of India will pick up 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan by infusing capital of Rs 2,450 crore.

yes bank,11-03-2020,Yes Bank stock appears to have become a trading play: Amar Deo Singh,"Amar Deo Singh, Head Advisory, Angel Broking, cautions those trading Yes Bank as there is still no clarity yet on its future course of action.

He also advises against trading at the current juncture as 'uncertainty still looms large', but feels it could be a good buying opportunity for long term investors with valuations turning attractive.

Edited excerpts:

Q: In January, we hit a fresh record high and now the market is at a 52-week low? Can we say that we are firmly in a bearish grip or downtrend? What are the important levels to watch out for?

A: Technically, the short and medium term indicators have turned negative. However, the long term charts point towards a major support zone around the 10,000-10,200 mark.

One needs to definitely trade with caution as uncertainty still looms large. However, it could be a good buying opportunity with valuations turning attractive.

Q: What is the way ahead for the Indian market and what to you were the factors that led to the fall?

A: The market was extremely volatile from March 2 to March 6, with domestic benchmark indices closing almost 2 percent in the red and many stocks being hammered in excess of 5-10 percent.

Negative global sentiment due to the coronavirus outbreak, coupled with the Yes Bank crisis, hit the market hard and shook investor confidence, wiping out crores in investor wealth.

In an emergency move, the US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.5 percent, its first such emergency move since 2008 in response to the growing threat from the coronavirus outbreak.

Other global central banks are also geared up to take any such measure that they feel can stem the slowdown in the global economy. The Indian market is taking cues from its global peers. Till such time that we witness a soothing of investor concerns and the coronavirus outbreak being contained, the market is likely to remain volatile.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned net sellers in March so far, after being net buyers for the past six months, clearly mirroring happenings across the globe.

Q: What are the important levels to watch out for on the Nifty and Bank Nifty?

A: Major indices witnessed very high volatility last week, with the Nifty correcting almost 2 percent and Bank Nifty by around 4.6 percent.

Technically, the Nifty has strong support around 10,800 and 10,600 mark, which is also its previous major bottom that it made in August 2019. On the upside, resistance is seen around the 11,300-11,400 mark.

The Bank Nifty has crucial support around its previous bottom, i.e. 26,500-26,600 zone, whereas resistance is seen around 28,800-29,200 levels.

Q: What is the way out for shareholders of Yes Bank? Has it become a trading play? Also, what about the funds that have invested in the bank?

A: Yes Bank shareholders are in for a tough time ahead. It is definitely a sorry state of affairs. Given the type of volatility being witnessed in the Yes Bank stock, it appears to have become a trading play.

We would advise caution while dealing in this scrip as there is still no clarity yet on its future course of action. As RBI is seized of the matter, greater clarity shall emerge in coming weeks with regard to funds that have invested in the bank.

Q: Any important event which investors should watch out for this week?

A: Markets globally are adapting on a real-time basis to events unfolding with regard to the coronavirus outbreak. Hence, we are witnessing heightened volatility for the past couple of weeks.

Investors definitely need to be alert as news flow could fly, thick and thin. So, adopting a calibrated approach would be best, till greater clarity emerges.

On the events front, the European Central Bank (ECB) meets this week for their monetary policy statement. Investors should pay attention as it has a bearing on global markets.

Q: What is your near term target for the dollar-rupee?

A: The rupee depreciated by over 2 percent last week against the dollar on global concerns. It would now take a breather and consolidate in the 72.50-74.50 zone.

In case, we see any new negative developments on the coronavirus issue, then that could be a trigger for further depreciation in the rupee, else it could trade rangebound in the near future.

Q: Which sectors or stocks are likely to be impacted the most by the coronavirus outbreak? Can IT and pharma ride out the storm?

A: A sharp correction in crude oil prices should help reduce our energy bill, meaning a narrower current account deficit India. Pharma and IT have so far weathered the storm, but one needs to be cautious here as well, given the prevailing global uncertainty.

Q: The debacle in Yes Bank comes close on the heels of the Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank episode. What does it tell you about the banking system? Do you think this would weigh on financials for some more time?

yes bank,11-03-2020,Valuations still lofty for HDFC twins: Aberdeen Standard Investments,"Markets are going through volatility, many investors are sitting on the sidelines. So, at the moment, we are certainly not seeing money coming in, said Hugh Young, head of Asia Pacific of Aberdeen Standard Investments.

""We are not seeing open-ended mutual funds (MFs) -- we are not seeing cash rushing into the market at the moment. For us, it is more a matter of sitting on the funds we have, either rejigging our portfolio, adding to areas where we think have been oversold, maybe taking a bit of money out of areas that have remained very resilient. We do have a bit of cash in funds but typically that is a residual amount of one-two percent for eventualities and at the moment by and large we are sitting on cash particularly in open-ended funds, just in case there are redemptions,” he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Speaking about Indian market, he said, “We typically remain largely invested. We don’t take major cash decisions when people have decided to go into a dedicated India fund partially because you never know whether they might have positions against themselves. So our portfolios by and large are fully invested. We do keep a bit of cash for redemptions.""

""One of our concerns has simply been that India is one of the most expensive markets and growth has not being coming through as expected. In India’s case - economic growth and earnings growth hasn’t been as strong as we were hoping for.”

“Broadly, financials could go through pain but it is going to be certain financials, which need to go through the pain. One of the issues, again specific to India has been that the financial sector is a bit of a mess and really hasn’t been cleaned up as it should have been. The silver lining in the dark cloud of Yes Bank is that things are being cleared up,"" he said, adding that as far the house is concerned, they have stuck with the quality end of the spectrum like the HDFCs, the Kotaks. However, the issue there is one of valuation and that one could see the valuation come down but they are not yet tempted to go into the lower quality end of the financial market and prefer to stick with co-holdings in the good long-term winners, said Young.

He added that valuations are still lofty for the HDFC twins.

“China’s market has held up remarkably well considering the coronavirus issue. One would have thought China would be one of the worst affected markets, but it hasn’t been. There has been support coming in for the China market but if anything, it has got more expensive relative to India. However, in absolute terms India still remains an expensive market, "" he said.

""I doubt there would be much major rejigging but given what is going on with markets at the moment, it is very hard to say anything with complete confidence,” he further mentioned.

When asked if he would increase allocations in Asian Paints, he replied, “We have been long-term holders in the paint sector. It has done fabulously over the last few decades. The holdings in that sector are far from cheap. The companies get long-term benefit from the lower input costs, so the house is comfortable holding them at the moment,"" he added.

yes bank,11-03-2020,"After Yes Bank crisis, SEBI may limit MFs' exposure to AT1 bonds: Report","Following the Yes Bank crisis, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) may limit the exposure of debt mutual funds (MFs) to additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds, according to a Business Standard report.

As of January 31, MF’s exposure to AT1 bonds is Rs 37,687 crore, the report said citing data from primemfdatabase.com. AT1 bonds, classified as quasi-equity instruments, are usually riskier than tier-1 bonds.

“The market regulator will take a look at the exposure level to such bonds in individual schemes. In some of the funds, the exposure levels are 20-30 percent of the scheme’s assets. The regulator is likely to question such excesses,” the chief executive of a fund house told the paper.

In its draft resolution plan for Yes Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that any instruments qualifying as AT1 capital would be written down.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

The RBI’s proposal on Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds suggests that preferential treatment will not be given to the bondholders over shareholders, the source mentioned earlier told Business Standard.

Bondholders have invested nearly Rs 94,000 crore in AT1 bonds issued by Indian banks, according to rating agency ICRA."
yes bank,11-03-2020,"Yes Bank crisis: ED probing NPAs of over Rs 20,000cr","Over Rs 20,000 crore of Yes Bank’s non-performing assets (NPAs) are under the Enforcement Directorate’s scanner. The investigation agency is probing whether these loans were disbursed after receiving instructions directly from the bank’s co-founder Rana Kapoor and whether the latter received ‘kickbacks’ for approving the same, a source told Moneycontrol.

Sleuths suspect that while granting these loans there was a lack of proper due diligence and non-adherence to norms as laid down by the Reserve Bank that led to these loans turning bad later.

ED will soon begin questioning officials from companies that have gone bad, with a source saying that the ""list of these companies may increase in coming days as the investigation proceeds."" The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will also partner with ED in this probe.

It is likely to call its Yes Bank officials and its former Managing Director Ravneet Gill for questioning in coming days.

Kapoor is also suspected to have created several shell companies, some in the name of his family members, which ED suspects were used to receive kickbacks from the companies gone bad, the source added.

Yes Bank has a total exposure of over Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Of this, around Rs 42,000 crore has gone bad. The actual number of NPAs under the scanner could rise from the current Rs 20,000 crore once the true picture of Yes Bank's financials are revealed. RBI-appointed administrator Prashant Kumar said Yes Bank will announce its third quarter results on March 14.

On February 12, the private lender had informed exchanges that its Q3 earnings will be delayed beyond the regulatory timeframe, citing receipt of “non-binding expressions of interests (EoIs)” and discussions with “several prominent investors” for capital raising.

As per regulatory norms, a company must declare results within 45 days of a quarter end.

The investigation agency is also probing Kapoor's property in the UK and US, the source said. It has provisionally attached 47 paintings, including the one bought from Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in 2010 for Rs 2 crore.

Officials are interrogating Rana, his wife Bindhu and daughter Roshni at present. Rana’s custodial interrogation ends on March 11.

Troubles at the new-generation private sector started brewing ever since RBI denied an extension to Kapoor – who is in the ED’s custody on charges of financial mismanagement and money-laundering -- to continue as MD and CEO in September 2018, and had asked the lender to find a new successor.

On March 5, the banking regulator had put a moratorium on the cash-strapped bank, imposed withdrawal restriction of Rs 50,000 till April 3 and superseded its board through appointment of an administrator.

ED arrested Rana on March 8 after registering a case against him on March 7. The case also names former Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, who are accused of paying a Rs 600 crore bribe to Rana’s family.

CBI has registered a case against 12 entities including Yes Bank; Rana; Bindhu; their daughters Raakhe, Radha and Roshni; their companies Doit Urban Ventures (India), RKW Developers and Morgan Credits; DHFL; and Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan."
yes bank,11-03-2020,"RBL Bank says it is financially strong, well capitalized","In the aftermath of Yes Bank crisis, Private sector lender RBL Bank on March 11 said it is ""well capitalised"" and there is no adverse change in its asset quality. The statement comes in the wake of the Yes Bank crisis, following which stock prices of various banks went sharply down.

""The management of RBL Bank wishes to address the prevailing concerns around the bank which is based on misinformation, and warrants clarification,"" it said in a statement.

The lender further said that: ""We wish to re-emphasize that RBL Bank is a fundamentally strong institution. Rumours around financial health and stability of the institution especially in social media seem to be misplaced, motivated and not based on facts"".

The bank said it is well capitalised, has healthy liquidity, growth is on track and management remains firmly committed.

""There has been no material adverse change in the asset quality since we announced our Q3 financial results on 22 January 2020 and our guidance remains consistent,"" the bank said.

The bank further said that it has a capital adequacy ratio of 16.08 per cent with Tier-1 at 15.02 per cent (significantly higher than the prescribed regulatory requirement at 11.5 per cent and 9.5 per cent respectively).

""All our business segments are doing well, we continue to expand presence across newer geographies by adding branches and are also hiring more people as previously planned,"" the statement said adding that the bank continues to attract additional deposits from retail, corporates and institutional segments.

Shares of RBL Bank were trading at Rs 230.25, higher by 10.80 per cent over its previous close in early trade on BSE.

The stock had witnessed significant downtrend and had slumped over 30 per cent in the previous two trading sessions."
yes bank,09-03-2020,Govt has no plans to bring other pvt sector lenders under scrutiny post Yes Bank crisis: Source,"The government is not considering to bring other private sector lenders under scrutiny in the aftermath of Yes Bank crisis that has left lakhs of customers worried if their hard earned money is really safe in banks. ""There is no such plan,"" said an official source when asked if the Yes Bank crisis preceded by Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) bank debacle calls for scrutiny of other lenders also.

The official said that there has been timely action on part of both the government as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

""The bailout plan has also been announced, so this will be contained,"" said the official.

However, analysts expect that the new generation private sector lenders alongside the cooperatives could face slow growth in their deposits as the banking business is based on trust and confidence.

S&P Global Ratings said if Yes Bank's resolution process is prolonged, there is a risk the broader banking environment may take a hit.

""The uncertainty may engulf weak financial-sector entities, including non-bank finance companies or private-sector banks. Companies with marginal credit profiles, perceived governance issues, and aggressive risk appetites are particularly vulnerable. These could suffer from extended risk aversion, resulting in rising borrowing costs,"" S&P Global Ratings said.

Yes Bank being put under administration has further eroded the confidence in the financial sector in India. After IL&FS, DHFL and PMC Bank, this is a bigger setback given its size and profile, said Tarun Bhatia, MD & Head of South Asia in the Business Intelligence and Investigations practice of Kroll.

Brokerage firm Anand Rathi said deposit growth for select banks may slow down. ""The banking system is based on goodwill and trust. Given the recent events (including at PMC and Yes), new age private banks and smaller regional banks may see slower deposit growth, Anand Rathi said in a note on 'India Banks? Likely contagion effect of Yes Bank'.

It said although the regulator and the government have in both cases stepped in to safeguard the interests of depositors, ""we expect retail investors to park their deposits in PSBs and select larger private banks"".

At least in the short run, deposit growth in new-age private and smaller regional banks could therefore significantly slow down. This may push up their cost of funds, eating into their margins. Loan growth of private banks with higher C/D (cost to deposit) ratios could be slower, it added.

""The event raises serious issues around corporate governance in the bank but will now bring all other mid and small size banks under scanner too. The cost of capital will increase for the banks and there could be increase in asset side risks with growing concern on the quality of portfolio they hold,"" said Bhatia of Kroll -- a division of Duff & Phelps -- on Yes Bank development.

During the moratorium period, Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

As per the RBI's draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India (SBI) will pick up 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan by infusing capital of Rs 2,450 crore.

Bank's financial health is not sound as it has failed to raise enough capital under the new leadership of Ravneet Singh Gill, who took charge as managing director and CEO from March 1, 2019.

Troubles at new generation private sector started brewing up ever since the Reserve Bank denied extension to its co-founder Rana Kapoor -- who now is in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate for financial mismanagement and money laundering charges -- to continue as MD and CEO in September 2018 and had asked the lender to find a new successor."
yes bank,09-03-2020,"Amid concerns over deposit safety, RBI dismisses use of m-cap ratio as parameter to assess banks","The state of affairs at private sector lender Yes Bank has dealt yet another blow to customers' faith in the Indian banking sector.

The Yes Bank episode comes close on the heels of the capitulation of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank .

A media report noted that the health parameter as far as banks are concerned should be their market capitalisation (m-cap) ratio. It defined m-cap ratio as -- deposits of the bank/ value of the company in the stock market.

The value arrived at using this formula, the report said, helps ascertain the health of your bank. If the value is 2.5 or less, the bank with your money is healthy. It added that a comfortable m-cap ratio lies anywhere between 2 to 4 and anything above 4 is risky.

Using this formula, the report aarived at m-cap ratio for various banks, and that for Yes Bank stood at 8.96.

However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dismissed these reports, adding that the analysis itself is flawed.

""Concern has been raised in certain sections of media about safety of deposits of certain banks. This concern is based on analysis which is flawed. Solvency of banks is internationally based on Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) and not on market cap,"" the central bank tweeted.

Assuring all depositors regarding the safety of their deposits, the RBI said it closely monitors all banks.

Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) KV Subramanian also allayed fears of depositors saying that Indian banks are well-capitalised. He also pointed out that the use of m-cap ratio to measure the safety and solvency of a bank is incorrect. Additionally, he said that the standard measure used to assess the financial health and safety of a bank is its CRAR.

Meanwhile, bankers and analysts also refuted the use of m-cap ratio to assess a bank's financial health, especially from the point of view of a lay person.

""You cannot judge health of a bank through its market cap,"" said Yuvraj Choudhary, analyst at Anand Rathi. He added that in case of the Indian banking system, the central bank provides certain safeguards, and hence people need not really worry about their deposits going bust. This, especially when the finance minister and the chairman of a public sector bank have stepped up and assured people.

The parameters that a retail investor could look at instead are: capital adequacy of a bank, the composition of its deposits-- retail, wholesale, corporate, the texture of the retail advances of the bank, net non-performing assets (NPA) of the bank and other such factors.

Last week, the RBI placed a moratorium on private sector lender Yes Bank wherein withdrawals from the bank were capped at Rs 50,000 for a month-long period. What followed this move was the obvious scene-- people queuing up outside the bank to withdraw their money."
yes bank,09-03-2020,Hopeful of moratorium being lifted this week: Yes Bank administrator,"In what may calm harried depositors of Yes Bank, its administrator Prashant Kumar on March 9 said he is hopeful of the moratorium on the private sector lender being lifted by Saturday. Merging Yes Bank with itself will have a ""negative impact"" on SBI, and an independently running institution should continue to do so after some help, Kumar, the former chief financial officer of SBI, said, dismissing speculation of an amalgamation.

In an interview to PTI, he also said that life insurance behemoth LIC was never approached for infusing capital and is not part of the plan now as well. Kumar was installed as the administrator of the bank by the Reserve Bank of India last Thursday, after the central bank superseded Yes Bank's board as it found that there was no headway in capital raising plans.

""We are hopeful that we will be able to work around, where the moratorium will be lifted by this weekend,"" he said, making it clear that moratorium lift-off and the capital raising plans are ""unconnected"".

""The trigger (for the lift-off of moratorium) will be approval of final (resolution) plan by RBI,"" he said, adding that work on fund raising is on in parallel.

On the capital raising, where there are reports of the bank needing at least Rs 20,000 crore to spring back to normalcy, he declined to give an estimate of the requirement but said it would like for most of the fund raising to happen in the first round itself.

""As of now, we are expecting that most of our capital requirement will be met initially itself. It may or may not happen. Definitely our plan is that we should complete the (entire) capital raising requirement before declaration of annual results, which is May 31, 2020,"" he said.

Kumar said it is possible that depositors may make a beeline to withdraw or transfer their deposits out of the bank once the moratorum is lifted and added that while there is no case for the depositors to act this way, Yes Bank has commitments from both the RBI and SBI to help with liquidity.

The bank is on track to come out with the results for December quarter on Saturday, he said, listing the preparation of the accounts as among his top priorities right now along with calming depositors and capital raising.

""The results on 14th will give complete picture on what is the position as of now, how much more impact will be there in the future because of our stressed book and what will be the requirement (of capital),"" Kumar said.

When asked if a forensic audit of the books by a third party is required to have a better picture, he replied in the negative.

""Not required absolutely. It is not a question of restating at all...if in your balance sheet, you come out clean, then where is the issue?"" Kumar questioned.

He also said that the moratorium-followed by SBI-led restructuring was the best that the government and the RBI could do, given the circumstances and underlined that a plan to merge is not advisable.

""Merger is not something which is good. Merger means a negative impact on SBI... instead of merger, you can always support to see that these institutions (are) run independently,"" he said, adding this is a ""strategic investment"" for SBI.

Kumar said in the case of Global Trust Bank case, which is cited often, it was a merger which could be directly carried out, whereas the rules under the Banking Regulation Act make it necessary for a bank to go into a moratorium first before a restructuring can be carried out.

On the reports of LIC being involved in the plan, he said, ""We are not looking at LIC. But if they want to come, they are most welcome. These are all rumours or some stories. Right from the beginning, LIC was not there at all"".

When asked if he expects legal challenges to the restructuring plan, given that the AT-1 bond holders have threatened to move courts, he said the investors were given a higher premium against the risk of losing all the money in case of an event.

Refusing to disclose what role he will be playing once the moratorium is lifted, Kumar also welcomed the role played by the employees over the last few days and assured that he will speak to them directly as the days progress.

Depositors' money is absolutely secure and they should not panic, he appealed, adding that they should not think of moving it into any other firm, asserting the bank will ""come out more stronger""."
yes bank,09-03-2020,"Yes Bank crisis: Depositors' interest top priority, says SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar","When RBI imposed a moratorium on Yes Bank, it led to widespread panic in the financial ecosystem. But when it became public that State Bank of India (SBI) has emerged as the white knight of the troubled private lender, it assuaged the concerns of investors as well as depositors.

In an interview with CNN-News18, Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI, explained how his bank is preparing the ground for Yes Bank's turnaround and the hurdles ahead.

Edited excerpts:

Q: How is the hunt for investors (for Yes Bank) going? Is SBI's presence giving investors confidence?

A: There's a very good response and all the ends are being tied...We will tell RBI soon that these are the people who are willing to invest along with us. RBI has to decide who will be the other co-investor.

Q: As part of the scheme, Yes Bank won't be merged with SBI. Will you be open for any eventuality where Yes Bank is merged with other bank?

A: We have not given a thought to it. There were efforts last year (of private bank acquiring it). The size of Yes Bank is fairly large. Except for HDFC Bank, it is very difficult for any other bank to acquire it.

SBI won't have any hesitation if any bank wants to acquire Yes Bank on the basis of RBI guidelines. SBI will always ensure that the bank is stable and depositors feel their money is safe...

Q: You once said that Uday Kotak is best suited to acquire Yes Bank. Is it right that Kotak Mahindra Bank bank did not acquire Yes Bank due to high-level of NPAs?

A: That was a light-hearted remark of mine to Uday Kotak in a panel discussion. Don't take that remark too seriously.

Q: What is the expected timeline SBI has set to revive Yes Bank?

A: We are working on recapitalisation now. We will notify RBI with our required investment with co investors. When moratorium is lifted and new management takes over, they will further evaluate situation.

Q: How is SBI planning to go about in resusciating Yes Bank ?

A: A bank which has more than 1,100 branches, there will always be a control premium. There are various considerations on whch these things are decided.

Q: When the regulator has decided to write down 81 bond holders worth nearly 10,000 cr, why is it writing down the equity capital? Does it look ethically wrong?

A: I can't comment because it is in tte regulatory domain. The depositors need not worry. The board and managemeny will work towards resolving the issue.

Q: Why did you restrict SBI's ownership to just 49 percent?

A: We don't want 51% stake or want it to be a subsidary. Our intention is to give confidence to depositors. A credible name like SBI supporting Yes Bank is the need of the hour.

Q: What is the estimated level of NPAs? Rumours doing rounds peg it at more than Rs 50,000 cr?

A: Yes Bank is announcing its results on 14th March.

Q: Is SBI roping in investors who are willing to acquire more than 5 percent stake in Yes Bank?

It is not in our hands. We will give the list to RBI and they will then decide."
yes bank,09-03-2020,"Customers sensed all was not well with Yes Bank, withdrew Rs 18,110cr deposits during March-September 2019","Deposits at Yes Bank witnessed a steady decline during the March-September period last year as customers withdrew over Rs 18,100 crore, in a reflection of falling confidence in the bank. Yes Bank, which has been put under a moratorium by the Reserve Bank till April 3, during which customers are not allowed to withdraw more than Rs 50,000, had deposits worth Rs 2,27,610 crore at the end of March 2019 (or end of 2018-19 fiscal).

However, it fell to Rs 2,25,902 crore by the end of the first quarter ended June of the current fiscal year (2019-20) and further to Rs 2,09,497 crore by the end of the second quarter ended September of FY20.

The difference in deposits between March 2019 to September 2019, reflects withdrawals to the tune of Rs 18,110 crore.

Data beyond September is not available as the cash-strapped bank had announced that there will be a delay in publishing its results for the third quarter.

A Delhi-based customer said that he sensed that all was not good with the private sector lender and withdrew his majority of deposits beforehand, leaving only with the minimum balance to keep the account active.

""We kept hearing that there was some problem with the bank, therefore we took out our money well before the withdrawal restriction was imposed on the bank,"" he said on the condition of anonymity.

During the many months in the past, the bank battled hard to keep the rumour mongering at the bay, issuing statements that everything was fine and customers need not to worry about their deposits.

""Over the past few weeks, there has been a lot of unfounded speculation about Yes Bank's board and management stability, asset portfolio, future growth prospects amongst other things.

""We strongly refute such speculations which we suspect is a deliberate and malicious attempt to create instability in the institution by undermining investor and client confidence. We have apprised the authorities of these developments. The financial position of Yes Bank is sound and stable and its liquidity and operating performance continue to be robust,"" the bank said in a statement issued on July 8, 2019.

Another customer said he had limited deposits in Yes Bank and was not really worried much as the insurance amount has now been raised to Rs 5 lakh.

""Even as I could withdrew Rs 50,000 through cheque, I am not really worrying much as my account has limited cash. Moreover, the deposit insurance now covers up to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier, so there is not any such problem to me,"" said Lalit Kumar, a Delhi based Yes Bank customer.

A couple of other customers said they have pulled out all their money from the bank so there is nothing to worry for them.

However, a female customer reposed confidence and looked calmed, saying the government and the Reserve Bank have swung into action very swiftly and there is no need to worry.

She said she had come to the bank to withdraw the stipulated Rs 50,000 through cheque and there was no such problem in doing that.

Even as the customers were hassled since last Thursday late evening, queuing up before the Yes Bank ATMs across the country, the bank has assured that their deposits are safe and they can withdraw the money both for their own and other banks ATMs.

During the moratorium period, Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

As per the RBI's draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India will pick up 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan by infusing capital of Rs 2,450 crore.

Bank's financial health is not sound as it has failed to raise enough capital under the new leadership of Ravneet Singh Gill, who took charge and Managing Director & CEO from March 1, 2019.

Troubles at new generation private sector started brewing up ever since the Reserve Bank denied extension to its co-founder Rana Kapoor -- who now is in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate for financial mismanagement and money laundering charges -- to continue and MD and CEO in September 2018 and had asked it to find a new successor.

The bank has a pan-India presence with branches in over 29 states and Union Territories. There were 1,450 ATMs, and 1,120 branches by end of March 2019."
yes bank,09-03-2020,Yes Bank saga: How the cookie crumbled,"When promoters Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur ousted their one-time partner Harkirat Singh from Yes Bank shortly after getting the bank licence in 2003-04, they had a clear plan in place - launch a private bank that will function as aggressively as a non-banking finance company.

They had envisioned it as an entity that will bet on the wholesale business for quick bucks in a short time instead of embarking on a slow moving retail business.

The Kapoor-Kapur duo was unlike anything Indian banking industry had seen till then. Traditionally, banking was seen as a slow and steady business. Kapoor, unlike a mundane conventional banker, presented himself as a suave and tech-saavy banker.

Yes Bank was a new generation lender in its looks and functioning. The bank, which hit the ground along with Kotak Mahindra Bank in 2003-2004, was no less than a foreign bank in appeal. Kapoor simultaneously built his own brand by hosting mega conferences sponsored by Yes Bank.

High growth, high return

Even in the case of Yes Bank, the lender did not attract much attention in the industry in the intial years of its operations. But a decade later, the whole story changed.

After the death of Ashok Kapur in the 26/11 terrorist attack, Kapoor practically got the undisputed control of the Yes Bank management.

Also Read: Explained | The impact of Yes Bank's AT1 bonds on debt fund investors

According to banking industry officials, Kapoor used to decide on most loan proposals leaving only the formalities to the bank's credit committee. What worked in favour of Kapoor was the fact that the RBI regulations were not strict enough those days to look into individual loan transactions and the processes followed. By rule, all major loan proposals had to go through a credit committee.

Bet Big, Grow Big

Rana Kapoor's mantra was simple. Bet big, spend big and grow big. The composition of the loan book always tilted towards corporate loans with this aim. The strategy worked for Kapoor for a long period.

""In cases where Kapoor lent to AA or AAA-rated firms, one can’t find fault with him for this reason alone. Most of the banks were doing that at that juncture,"" said Naresh Malhotra, a former SBI banker, who works as a banking consultant now.

Also Read | Withdrawal cap at Yes Bank may be lifted as early as March 15, says Prashant Kumar

Similarly, credit committees were often nudged to follow the promoter's decision.

""In many promoter driven banks, credit committees just exist for the sake of it while the decisions are influenced by the promoter,"" Malhotra said.

Retail loans and small company loans were not a big priority of Kapoor. The founder relied onto high fee income business (payment upfront from the loan amount) and some amount of micro, small and medium enterprise loans.

""No banking analyst, rating agency or regulator questioned this kind of growth. All were happy to sing praises to the business model,"" said a leading banking analyst in Mumbai on condition of anonymity.

Yes Bank would lend to any company who approached Kapoor for funds. Between financial year 2014 and 2019, Yes Bank's loan book grew from Rs 55,000 crore to Rs 2,50,000 crore. Of this, between FY17 and FY19, the loan book almost doubled. This implies a CAGR of 38 percent while even the best of times, Indian banks haven't grown beyond 25 percent.

Remember, during this period, the average lending growth of banks used to be 8-10 percent. Most other banks were struggling to grow their books. NPAs were rising high as economy slowed down. Particularly after the 2016 demonetisation, economic activities had slowed to a trickle across sectors. Despite all these, Yes Bank reported a huge growth in its loan books.

Rule violations

Everything was going well till 2017-18 wchich was marked by two major events. The RBI identified large divergence in the NPA numbers reported by Yes Bank and what RBI audit found. Second, the collapse of IL&FS in late 2018 created liquidity issues in the system. This resulted in huge stress on the books of Yes Bank as repayments stopped from companies which were typically borrowing from NBFCs to roll over funds. Most NBFCs had stopped lending.

This was more evident in the case of real estate developers which were getting money from NBFCs. When the flow of money came to a grinding halt, corporate heavy lenders such as Yes Bank felt the heat.

Costs of liabilities were way high for Yes as HNI deposits constituted a sizeable chunk, rather than cheaper savings deposits. Yes Bank did a lot of structured financing underwhich it lent to companies, eventhose who were not getting money from other banks. The companies Yes Bank lent to included many which no other bank was willing to lend to. DHFL, Essar, IL&FS and Vodafone were a few of the names along with some little known real estate companies.

Bigger than the ICICI-Kochhar case?

Kochhar allegedly played an instrumental role to give a Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group which, in turn invested Rs 64 crore in Nupower owned by Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband).

So far, the details available from the investigations suggest that the Rana Kapoor episode could turn out to be even more damning than the one involving Chanda Kochhar. That is because according to the CBI charge sheet, Kapoor misused his official position in several transactions, including the DHFL loan case. In ICICI-Kochhar case, the issue was pertaining to one account.

Kapoor allegedly played an instrumental role in Yes Bank's investment of Rs 3,700 crore in DHFL papers, while DHFL in turn lent Rs 600 crore to Doit Urban Ventures, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises (lndia) Private Limited, in which his wife Bindu is a director and 100 percent shareholder.

""There is no crime in having an aggressive business model. But, at one point, the man and the bank became synonyms (in Yes Bank's case). When you are the founder and CEO of a regulated entity, it is important that you draw a clear line between the bank and the family businesses,"" said Tarun Bhatia, Managing Director, Kroll, Businss Intelligence and investigations.

Kapoor forgot this rule somewhere along the way. As the investigators dig deeper, more dirt may come out."
yes bank,09-03-2020,Will SBI's 49% stake buy in Yes Bank create conflict of interest in Yes AMC?,"The ongoing crisis at Yes Bank has the potential to trigger a domino effect in Indian financial markets, and the job of markets regulator SEBI is no less daunting.

One tricky issue arising out of the Yes Bank episode is how to avoid a potential conflict of interest when State Bank of India (SBI) acquires 49 percent stake in the troubled private lender.

In that scenario, SBI becomes the main promoter of Yes Bank, which in turn, holds a majority stake in Yes AMC.

And, that is where the problem lies.

SEBI regulations do not explicitly limit one AMC per sponsor but they do mention avoidance of conflict of interest situation, according to a former SEBI officer who worked in its MF department.

""SBI is set to become de-facto sponsor of two mutual funds - SBI MF and Yes MF - which creates a prima facie conflict of interest situation,"" said the former SEBI officer.

SBI MF presently is in numero uno spot with AUM of RS 3.80 lakh crore as of January 31, 2020, while Yes AMC had AUM of Rs 400 crore.

On March 6, the government launched a rescue plan for Yes Bank under which the State Bank of India (SBI) will pick a 49 percent stake as part of a restructuring proposal.

On March 5, SBI said its board had given in-principle approval to explore an investment in Yes Bank. Earlier that day, in a sudden move, the RBI took control of Yes Bank and limited withdrawals.

RBI restricted withdrawals that customers can make from their YES Bank accounts to Rs 50,000 until April 3, 2020.

The moratorium comes after the Rana Kapoor-promoted bank failed to raise capital to address potential loan losses and in the wake of deteriorating financials of the bank.

SEBI Directions

In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had asked France-based firm BNP Paribas for details on how it intends to continue its mutual fund (MF) business in India as BNP Paribas owned Fortis Mutual Fund and also held a stake in Sundaram BNP Paribas Asset Management.

SEBI had asked BNP Paribas to choose either or merge the two, as regulations do not permit an entity from having stakes in two asset management companies.

It remains a conjecture how SBI would approach its overall handling of being a parent to two MFs simultaneously. Will SBI approach SEBI with a merger proposal of Yes AMC with SBI AMC remains to be seen, fund experts said."
yes bank,09-03-2020,"Coronavirus impact: GJEPC postpones intl gem, jewellery show in Jaipur to July","Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has rescheduled its international gem and jewellery show in Jaipur from April to July on account of coronavirus outbreak. In a statement, the council has said due to concerns related to the global coronavirus outbreak, they have decided to postpone the dates to July 18-20, 2020.

There are serious concerns globally pertaining to the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, adversely affecting everyone's travel plans, it said.

""Considering the concerns and sensitivities of the countries impacted, the health and safety of exhibitors and visitors, after much deliberation with buyers and other stakeholders, there was no option but to reschedule the show,"" it added.

Further, the council said over 600 buyers from 56 countries which includes Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, and England, have registered so far.

Over 230 exhibitors have confirmed their participation from all over India.

During April 2019 to January 2020, exports declined 4.78 percent to Rs 2,16,076.06 crore as compared with Rs 2,26,933.91 crore during the ten months period of 2018-19.

The council also said that in view of the recent action taken by the Reserve Bank of India on Yes Bank, all exhibitors and visitors are advised not to deposit any cheques/NEFT/RTGS/IMP in that bank with immediate effects.

""GJEPC may not be able to provide credit for cheque's deposited in Yes Bank after March 5, 2020 in view of the restrictions imposed on transaction with Yes bank,"" it added.

The Reserve Bank last week imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account and superseding the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect."
yes bank,09-03-2020,"Investors' total AT-1 bond exposure to Indian banks at Rs 93,000 crore: ICRA","Investors have total bets of over Rs 93,000 crore on the additional tier-I bonds in Indian banks and a complete write-down proposed in the Yes Bank restructuring may lead to risk aversion, according to a report by domestic rating agency ICRA.

The report comes two days after IndusInd Bank virtually dropped a plan for the issue of the AT-1 bonds by deferring a board meet following the Yes Bank package by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), implementation of which is set to erode investments.

As part of the SBI-led restructuring package announced by the RBI, there is a proposal to write down the entire outstanding on AT-1 bonds, which has been pegged at Rs 8,695 crore by ICRA on March 9.

Investors have reportedly approached the banking regulator seeking help.

The proposal is ""likely to further increase the risk aversion of investors as the investors will factor in a higher probability of write-downs on these bonds"", ICRA said in the report.

Appetite for future issuances and also the investor base for future issuances will take a beating because of the move, it said.

A total of Rs 93,669 crore of AT-1 bonds is outstanding as on date (Rs 84,574 excluding Yes Bank), of which Rs 39,315 crore will be in private banks (Rs 30,620 crore excluding Yes Bank).

The largest outstanding is with SBI at Rs 27,432 crore, followed by ICICI Bank at Rs 10,120 crore, while the immediate call option is coming up for Bank of Baroda on a Rs 400 crore bond, it said.

Most of these bonds were issued in 2016-17 and 2017-18 with first call option after fifth year from issuance, which means large bonds are due for call in 2021-22 and 2022-23.

The reduction in the risk appetite for investors will be constraining banks from rolling over these bonds by exercising call option and fresh issuance, it said.

In such an event, and also the absence of fresh issuances, the capital buffers over regulatory levels will decline by an estimated 1 per cent of risk-weighted assets, it said.

The agency added that under the large exposure framework, exposure to single borrower or group of borrowers is linked to tier-1 capital, and reduction in tier-1 capital upon redemption of these bonds will also reduce the ability of the banks to take large exposures to a borrower group."
yes bank,09-03-2020,"Yes Bank insolvency may tighten credit market, widen economic pain: S&P Global Ratings﻿","S&P Global Ratings today said that quick resolution of Yes Bank's insolvency will keep India's banking sector contagion at bay, but as credit markets tighten there could be a possibility of wider economic pain in the country.

The Reserve Bank last week imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account and superseding the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Following this, country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on March 7 said that it will invest Rs 2,450 crore in the troubled private sector bank against 245 crore shares.

""The Indian government is working with the SBI to inject capital into Yes Bank, a troubled private-sector bank with 1.8 per cent of the country's bank deposits (as of March 31, 2019).

""Quick resolution of Yes Bank's insolvency will keep India bank-sector contagion at bay, though it poses pain for investors in bank hybrid securities. As credit markets tighten, we also see a possibility of wider economic pain in the country,"" S&P Global Ratings said.

It said the Indian government has consistently supported weak commercial banks by promoting the merger of distressed institutions with stronger lenders and has historically not allowed commercial banks to fail and has in the past swiftly stepped in to address trouble.

""The current weak economic and high-fear global investment environment, in our view, has prompted the government to support the recovery of Yes Bank. However, in better times, we believe the government would think twice about pushing such a package for relatively small banks,"" S&P said.

SBI will own a minimum of 26 percent of Yes Bank for the next three years. SBI's ownership should give confidence to depositors and lenders about the bank's solvency, it added.

The Reserve Bank has put out a draft resolution plan for Yes Bank allowing SBI to acquire 49 percent stake.

The ents follow Yes Bank's failure to raise capital to address loan losses, sparking a withdrawal of deposits.

India's central bank has highlighted serious governance issues at Yes Bank, lapses that have contributed to the institution's steady decline in recent years.

Any delay in, or uncertainty about, the implementation of the resolution plan may roil markets, S&P said.

""In our view, India's financial sector broadly needs to raise governance standards and restore trust. In the past few years, regulators have identified many governance shortcomings among Indian lenders, most recently at Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank Ltd,"" S&P said.

It said if Yes Bank's resolution process is prolonged, there is a risk the broader banking environment may take a hit. This may raise investors' perception of credit risk in the system, tightening funding.

""Many mutual funds hold Yes Bank securities, including subordinated debt and AT-1s. A depreciation in the value of these instruments would hurt credit funds, potentially triggering capital outflows. This could widen spreads and drain the credit available to lower-rated entities,"" S&P said.

The speed of the government action will be critical to provide clarity, it noted.

In the past cases of bank failures--such as the collapse of Global Trust Bank Ltd. Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. and Sangli Bank Ltd.--we have seen swift action that nipped contagion in the bud, S&P added."

Edited excerpt:

A) In the coming weeks, the Indian benchmarks indices will be volatile with increased concerns overs the coronavirus. In the upcoming trading sessions, traders need to be cautious and once Nifty50 crosses 11350, it is expected to start a bullish rally.

It has been more than 65 days since the outbreak of the first coronavirus case in Wuhan, China. As of now, China has reported that the death toll at 3,000+ and confirmed cases at 80,000+.

Although the pace of spread has slowed down a bit in China, it has started spreading in the other parts of the world.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that there have been over 267 deaths and 14,770 confirmed cases outside China. Countries like South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, and Middle Asia are highly effected.

China is one of the largest suppliers of raw materials and manufacturing hub for different industries, especially Auto, Metal, Pharma, etc. Due to the shutdown of the manufacturing hubs in the affected areas, there will be a shortage of supplies of electronic gadgets which is the major supplier for India.

According to a report by CRISIL, 18 percent of Indian merchandise is imported from China.

In the last couple of weeks, the global markets have dropped between 2-3 percent. The countries which were hit by the deadly COVID -19 has a seen a major downfall starting from USA’s Dow Jones which fell more than 950 points on Thursday; Japan’s Nikkei, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Australia's ASX 200, South Korea's Kospi, India’s NSE & BSE also fell sharply.

Although the central banks of various countries have taken a measure to reduce the downfall by cutting 25 to 50 basis points

A) In the past five trading sessions, the Nifty has been dominated by sellers. On Friday, the Nifty opened with a gap down of 327 points by taking a support level of 10,850.

For the current week, 11,000 will act as a key level. If the market has seen the upside there will be a resistance level at 11,150 and on the downside, the support level is at 10,700. For BankNifty, the key levels to watch are 28,500 for upside and in the 26,700 on the downside

A) On Friday, Yes Bank shares dropped 85 percent to the record low of 5.65 after the central bank of India has capped a withdrawal limit of 50,000 and imposed a moratorium on it.

Late in the evening, the RBI governor assured that the depositor’s money will be safe here. Apart from this, the Finance minister has said that “I want to assure every depositor's money is safe, and I’m in constant touch with RBI”.

Although the limit on the capped amount is only for a month. So, the depositors shouldn’t be worrying about their deposits as both RBI and government are working constantly to devise a plan within 30 days.

The investors need not worry and have to wait for further instructions from the central bank as they will be planning to raise the new funds by considering different options.

The RBI has announced the revival plan with various schemes starting from selling the 49 percent stake to the investment bank, reconstruction plans of the board members and assuring the salaries of the employees for one year.

A) USD INR is currently in an overbought condition. The reason behind this is that the Dollar Index is getting stronger due to the FED cut interest rate overnight.

Currently, USDINR is looking on the upper side and we may see short term top near 74.70 - 75.00 levels. Strong USD will benefit export-based companies and gold-related companies. IT sector will have more impact as strong USD is a benefit for this sector.

Pharma sector companies are dependent on imports especially the companies in oil and gas space will be adversely affected. Where there are huge foreign currency loans - say infrastructure will get negatively impacted.

A) Yes Bank debacle is indeed a cause of concern as this is a new generation bank set up by professionals but still, it struggled hard to sustain. Indian financial environment being bank-dominated, such fiascos seriously impact the markets.

It would be harsh to question the credibility of the whole banking system by seeing these incidents, strict regulatory control could surface the position of the Yes Bank and also its Governance issues, PMC being a cooperative bank does not come directly under control of RBI, and due to its cooperative structure, the board is not professional as it is elected by its members and thus the long term sustainability being in question.

This would weigh down on Financials and market sentiments in the short-term and unless some concrete investment comes up into it along with new management.

yes bank,09-03-2020,Yes Bank debt writedown to hit sector capital-raising,"The unexpected write-down of some bonds issued by crisis-hit Indian lender Yes Bank Ltd as part of a state-led rescue is set to raise borrowing costs and make capital-raising tougher for other banks, investors and analysts said.

The take over of Yes Bank by India's central bank last week comes against the backdrop of a string of scandals in the country's financial sector in the last couple of years - from a $2 billion fraud at a large state-owned bank to mismanagement of funds at shadow banks.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it would work on a revival plan, as part of which bonds classified as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital will be written down ""permanently, in full.""

So-called AT1 bonds were introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis. They carry higher interest rates than more senior debt as investors accept the risk they can lose their investment at certain pre-agreed points if the funds are needed to bolster a struggling bank's capital.

Yes Bank had about 88 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in AT1 capital as of March 2019, its annual report showed, under the Basel III framework. Investors included Nippon India Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton, a slew of local fund houses and retail investors.

""What this incident does is penalise the good names too,"" said a fund manager, who holds Yes Bank AT1 bonds, adding some investors are now considering a legal challenge against the central bank's plan to wipe them out.

""You're in effect creating an environment where the liquidity dries up on AT1s. Only risk-hungry funds will be buying AT1 bonds now,"" said the fund manager, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""A minimum 50-100 basis point rise in AT1 borrowing costs could happen.""

Nippon India and Franklin Templeton did not immediately provide comment to Reuters' queries.

Underscoring the challenges, mid-sized IndusInd Bank Ltd said on March 7 it was deferring its Monday board meeting to consider raising capital via debt issuance, including AT1 bonds.

IndusInd added it was adequately capitalised and the decision to defer was due to current market conditions.

""It's not that investors will altogether ignore BFSI as a sector,"" said Siddharth Purohit, research analyst at Mumbai-based SMC Institutional Equities, referring to the banking, financial services and insurance sectors.

""The large ones, who have the ability to absorb any shock and those who have a time tested model, will be in a position to raise money and keep on expanding their book.""

Government-owned State Bank of India, the country's biggest lender, said on March 7 that it would invest funds to buy a 49 percent stake in Yes Bank as part of the initial phase of a rescue deal.

While the bonds are designed to help a bank through a crisis, investors warned the fallout for other banks could be substantial.

Boutique rating agency Acuité Ratings warned in a note that the RBI's plan to wipe out AT1 holders would ""substantially add to the risk perception on these hybrid instruments and limit their issuances.""

""A resilient economy can digest these things very quickly and move on. The biggest concern is these things are happening when the economy has slowed down sharply,"" said the head of an Indian fund that manages more than $10 billion in assets.

The fund manager, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, added he has been paring his portfolio holdings of Indian bank shares due to economic headwinds."

According to the CBI FIR, the scam started taking shape between April and June 2018 when Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL).

Among those who have been affected is Snehal Pradhan, former member of the Indian women cricket team, who is in Australia currently.

She, like many other impacted people from across the globe, took to the microblogging site Twitter in search of a solution and also tagged Yes Bank's partner Bookmyforex.com.

Following the bank being put under moratorium and the restrictions thereof, the lender was unable to play its role to let UPI payments happen for popular apps like PhonePe which depended exclusively on the bank. The app was forced to switch to rival ICICI Bank within a day to restart transactions.

""In Australia for almost another week and my forex card has been deactivated. Why? Cos it's a Yes Bank card. Most of my currency is on that card and I'm stranded,"" Pradhan tweeted on March 6.

The scrip fell 85 percent intraday and closed 57 percent lower a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took over the private lender.

In a single session, investors of Yes Bank lost Rs 5,000 crore.

However, experts see a silver lining is SBI's assurance.

SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar on March 7 said once RBI's 30- day moratorium period ends, the largest lender of the country would take charge. SBI is allowed to buy up to 49 percent stake in Yes Bank and appoint two nominee directors along with an initial investment of upto Rs 2,450 crore. The investment can be increased to Rs 10,000 crore in the next three years during which it will have to a maintain 26 percent stake in Yes Bank.

""The Yes Bank problem has been a market concern for many months now. RBI preferred, and rightly so, an internal resolution of the problem through capital infusion. But now the central bank has acted since the bank management failed to raise capital. A quick resolution can be expected. There is no systemic issue or contagion consequences. No need to panic,"" VK Vijaykumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

SBI chairman said the bank would submit their resolution plan for Yes Bank soon. It will also start looking for both domestic and foreign investors to further sell stake of Yes Bank.

Overall, experts feel it is a big bailout by SBI to avoid PMC Bank like a situation.

""I believe the government's rescue plan bring out Yes Bank from an ICU emergency ward to normal ward, wherein, the health of the bank is still under checks. On the news SBI has expressed willingness to make an investment in Yes Bank and participate in its reconstruction scheme would just be like parenting support for a newly adopted child,"" Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities told Moneycontrol.

But the big question remains whether the bank can survive after the initial push.

Recently, the bank has witnessed a mass exodus. Customers have left, big corporates took their business elsewhere, foreign investors have bailed out and mutual funds are also reducing their stake.

Hence, even after the rescue plan, Tapse believes, Yes Bank stock will now be a trader’s play rather than an investment play.

According to Tapse, future growth is still under question. Hence, stay away from the stock at least for the time being, he said.

For traders Monday, he said the trend will likely be positive as uncertainty still lingers around the embattled bank.
