Relience_Industries,24-07-2020,"RIL, RIL partly paid shares hit all-time high; combined m-cap tops Rs 14L crore","Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) closed 4.15 percent higher at Rs 2,146.20 while those of Reliance Industries PP (partly paid) closed 8.77 percent higher at Rs 1,284.50 on BSE on July 24.

Both RIL and RIL PP hit their all-time highs of Rs 2,162.80 and 1,299, respectively, in intraday trade.

The m-cap of RIL stood at Rs 13,60,562.99 crore and that of RIL PP at Rs 54,262.45 crore on BSE on July 24.

With this, the combined market-capitalisation (m-cap) of RIL and RIL PP stock stood at 14.15 lakh crore on BSE.

Brokerages and analysts are bullish on Reliance Industries following its debt-free status, a healthy balance sheet and a strong growth outlook.

Brokerage firm BNP Paribas has maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,317.

""We reiterate 'buy' on RIL with a revised SoTP-based target price of Rs 2,317. We update for the Jio proceeds, which drive a large part of the increase in valuation along with a higher multiple for Jio and the retail

business in light of the potential growth outlook,"" said the brokerage.

""We now value RIL on an FY23E basis to better capture the growth outlook for all the businesses. Despite its recent run, RIL still has multiple catalysts in place in terms of a stake sale in retail and a potential sale in oil-to-chemical (O2C) even at a lower valuation (as it tries lower its dependence on O2C).""

The brokerage believes that Jio has played its role in reinventing RIL and now the focus will be on the consumer retail business.

""We do not think RIL is in a rush to start off-loading in retail also, but if it does, it will be a positive (according to media reports, RIL is looking to sell its stake in consumer retail). That said, retail by itself over the years will be a growth engine for RIL and something that will enable Jio also for cross-selling, in our view,"" BNP Paribas said.

While FY21 growth would be impacted by COVID-19, BNP Paribas expects RIL to regain the lost ground in FY22.

The brokerage said RIL weathered the weakness in global refining and chemicals due to its diversified businesses.

Japanese brokerage firm Nomura also has a 'buy' recommendation on the oil-to-retail conglomerate, with a target price to Rs 2,200.

""RIL is our preferred pick in India oil & gas. RIL is now outperforming the benchmark Nifty for the sixth year,"" Nomura said.

""While the run has been very strong, and valuations are getting rich, we believe the outperformance may sustain. Despite a subdued FY21F (weak energy business, COVID-19 impact), we expect a 29 percent CAGR in consolidated earnings over FY20-23F. Also, investor appetite is strong for consumer business. While institutional holding in RIL has been rising, we believe there is under-ownership, given the sharp rise in RIL’s weight in Nifty,"" Nomura said.

It said as RIL's very large CAPEX cycle drew to a close, earning increased for the energy business initially followed by sharp rises for Jio and retail.

Nomura said RIL's outperformance has also been driven by a sharp growth in new consumer businesses of Jio and Retail.

""With nearly 49 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in FY20, consumer businesses’ contribution to RIL’s aggregate EBITDA grew from 3 percent in FY17 to 35 percent in FY20. Further, we expect the share of consumer businesses in RIL’s consolidated EBITDA to increase to 52 percent by FY22F,"" said Nomura.

RIL will announce its June quarter earnings on July 30. Brokerages expect the company to report an improvement in the margin for Q1 due to flexible feedstock utilisation and better O2C integration.

""RIL is expected to report GRM at $9.0/bbl, helped by inventory gain as well as discounts offered to Indian refiners at the beginning of the quarter,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Outlook on full economic utilisation of petcoke gasifier will be in focus when the company announces its June quarter scorecard, Motilal Oswal said.

The second instalment of Rs 314.25 will be paid in May 2021 and last instalment of Rs 628.50 in November 2021.

The stock has been on the rise since the company announced investments from various marquee tech giants and private equity investors into Jio Platforms. It has raised more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore through stake sale in Jio since April 22.

This helped the company achieve its net debt free target much before its own timeline of March 2021, which was the key trigger.

Investment of Rs 33,737 crore by Google for 7.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms was announced recently at the AGM, while Rs 43,574 crore investment by Facebook for 9.9 percent stake in Jio was made public on April 22.

""Reliance Industries is India's largest company with a dominant presence in Refining, Petrochemicals, Telecom and Retail businesses.

Relience_Industries,22-07-2020,Rights issue becomes the new favourite; what's the rush for?,"A trend seems to have emerged among listed companies of raising funds via rights issue. Many companies, including the likes of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, PVR, Shriram Transport Finance, Aditya Birla Fashion, Reliance Industries (RIL), have offered their shareholders a chance to solidify their holding at a time when investor confidence is riding high despite the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

Ample liquidity due to stimulus packages from central banks and relatively cheap valuations in the aftermath of COVID-19-led crash could have been the fillip companies needed to opt for rights issue as the preferred means of raising funds as opposed to qualified institutional placements (QIP), experts suggested.

""It is understood that when valuations are stretched, companies usually raise capital via QIP route. And when shares are reasonably priced or are undervalued, promoters generally raise additional capital for growth through a rights issue, giving a chance to existing shareholders to buy the stock at a discounted price,"" said Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities.

According to Shah, investors should not always view raising funds as a quick fix to a bleeding balance sheet but should rather concentrate on why the company is raising funds. In many cases, companies use the funds for capital expenditure which is a telling sign that the management is optimistic about the growth prospects of the company.

""...raising of funds also shows the management’s confidence in the growth of their company. It is not always the case that additional capital is raised only because the company’s balance sheet is bleeding. Capital can also be raised to accentuate growth and expansion,"" she said.

A rights issue is a mechanism for listed firms to raise additional capital by inviting existing shareholders to buy new shares proportionate to their existing holding at a discount to the prevailing market price.

According to the management of the company, the rights issue is their way of thanking shareholders in the company's silver jubilee year. And thankful they were, as the scrip climbed over 10 percent on July 20, the announcement date. Although, the sharp rise can also be attributed to the stellar returns the company posted for the quarter ended June 2020.

The pricing of the issues was also hailed by analysts Moneycontrol spoke to. They believe that the company has multiple moats including a strong rural presence. Efficient cost control along with low borrowing cost also puts the company is a favourable position

“The announcement of the rights issue at a steep discount of Rs 50 against July 17's closing of Rs 207 per share is likely to be taken positively by the market. More than the rights issue, the steady growth in business along with signs of improvement in the niche segment of the company is likely to aid stock rally on a short-term basis,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder-CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

According to media reports, the Ajay Bijli-owned firm intends to utilise the net proceeds from the issue towards repayment or prepayment of the principal and or interest of certain borrowings availed by the company. PVR may also use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

PVR, which has 176 properties and a total of 845 screens across India, had completed a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in October 2019. The fundraising round led to an inflow of Rs 500 crore.

Part of the QIP proceeds was utilised towards prepayment of existing debt obligation.

Experts Moneycontrol spoke to advised subscribing to the issue given ABFRL's strong management as well as its growth prospects once the pandemic is contained and the economy fully re-opens. ""The rights issue is structured similarly to that of Reliance Industries where shareholders will have to make payments in three tranches. As the lockdown is gradually lifted, retail stocks seem to be in a rebound mode. The factors like manageable leverage, consistent execution capability, healthy cost-cutting initiatives and strong parentage might help ABFRL emerge much stronger from the current crisis,"" said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor."

Relience_Industries,20-07-2020,"Reliance Jio seeks spectrum for 5G trials, plans to sell tech overseas","Reliance Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology, according to sources.

The company's wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies.

According to sources, Reliance Jio on July 17 requested for 800 megahertz of frequencies in the 26 gigahertz (Ghz) and 24 Ghz band as well as 100 Mhz in 3.5 GHz band for running field trials in ""urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai"".

""Jio has said that high frequencies has been put to use in advance countries like the US, South Korea, Japan, Canada, the UK. They also want trials in these bands should start in India to make India ""Aatmanirbhar"". Government is open to the suggestion and trials. Already many trials are going on,"" an official source said.

The company has sought spectrum frequencies between 26.5 - 29.5 Ghz and 24.25-27.5 Ghz band. The auction for these high frequency bands is expected to be held next year.

UN body International Telecommunication Union approved 5G standards for 26 gigahertz band in November last year while the standards for other bands are yet to be decided.

In its pitch for starting trials in higher spectrum band, Jio in the letter has said that the US, South Korea, Japan etc have started working in 28 Ghz band and some other countries in 26 Ghz band and therefore it wants to run trials of its 5G technology before selling it abroad.

In the 43rd annual general meeting, Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch.

""This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India… using 100 percent home grown technologies and solutions. This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available and can be ready for field deployment next year,"" Ambani had said."
Relience_Industries,20-07-2020,'Nifty likely to face resistance near 100-Week EMA; IT index could rally another 5-7%',"We feel one may still see upsides to the tune of around 5-7 percent from hereon. Hence, we would suggest a buy on dips strategy rather than going gung ho, on the trot, Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, VP (Equities) at GEPL Capital, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:

A) The major part of the volatility can be attributed to the divergence that we have seen in the Nifty vis-à-vis the Bank Nifty. Within the Bank Nifty, we have seen a lot of heavyweights correct whereas the Nifty strength may be attributed to stellar moves in likes of RIL and the IT pack. This in a way has created a lot of fatigue where both the bulls as well as bears have had a real tug of war.

A) The major levels on the upside are 11,029 (100-Week EMA) followed by 11,389 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the earlier fall).

The weekly low of 10,562 (read 10,550 as it houses the 61.8 percent retracement level @ 10,544.8) would be the major support in contention.

A) The major flow for the IT Index has been the NASDAQ in the US hitting all-time highs, and which the Nifty IT too replicated in stride. The robust results further boosted the inflows in terms of the defensive sector.

We feel one may still see upsides to the tune of around 5-7 percent from hereon. Hence, we would suggest a buy on dips strategy rather than going gung ho, on the trot.

Q) Twitter Bitcoin hack is something which came out of the blue. A similar scam happens when retail investors, especially the new-age ones, get charmed by the SMS or email promising to give superior returns. Are there any red flags which you want to highlight for traders?

A) The major shift in the retail participation in the current upmove has been in heavyweights rather than penny stocks, which in a way offers a major safety net.

Also, the major chunk is coming through the indirect route i.e. MFs rather than investors taking bets on direct company-specific stuff.

As was the trend earlier of taking bets on so-called tips, we have seen it shift to people who do hand-holding during the process of trade. This also in a way indicates that Indian investors are maturing, slowly but surely.

However, there would always be some rotten eggs here and there, but we look at it as a part of the game.

A) Here is a list of top stocks for the next 3-4 weeks:

RIL: CMP: Rs 1,911 | Target: 1,985-2,050 | Stop loss: Rs 1,885

Aurobindo Pharma: CMP: Rs 836 | Target: Rs 950 | Stop Loss: Rs 809

Cadila Healthcare: CMP: Rs 378 | Target: Rs 420 | Stop Loss: Rs 344

Relience_Industries,20-07-2020,"With strong pipeline of deals, Bank of America expects 'busy' H2 this year","Global investment banking major Bank of America (BofA), which stood second in the India deal street ranking in the first half, is bullish on the remaining six months with a strong pipeline of deals, despite the COVID-19 pandemic hitting business sentiment.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-headquartered bank expects the deal street to be driven by both consolidation in the sectors impacted by the pandemic and financial institutions raising growth capital.

Raj Balakrishnan, the head of India investment banking at BofA says, the pandemic is unlike any other previous crises, which were business crises.

""A company that was being run perfectly well till February may not be viable now for no fault of the management, as its business may be hit due to the lockdowns. Further, the same company may be perfectly fine once lockdown is over and normalcy returns as long as it has sufficient liquidity to sail through the crisis,"" Balakrishnan told PTI, expressing confidence in the broader business recovery.

That is why, he said, raising capital is now the key to help emerge as a winner.

Thanks to Reliance Industries selling over a quarter of its stake in its subsidiary Jio Platforms, the deal street was vibrant clocking nearly $44 billion in H1 of 2020, up 14.5 percent YoY.

Between late April and June, Reliance sold nearly 25 percent in Jio Platforms to 10 investors, including Facebook, which snapped up 9.99 percent for over Rs 43,000 crore. Then it sold 15 percent more, collectively raising Rs 1.2 lakh crore including through the largest rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore in June.

Others who lapped up minority stake in Jio for $15.27 billion include Silver Lake Partners, General Atlantic, KKR and others. The selling spree continued in July with Google picking up 7.7 percent for over Rs 33,700 crore.

According to industry tracker Mergermarket, BofA stood second in the i-banking league table with deals worth $6.7 billion in the first half, capturing 17.6 percent market share. Morgan Stanley topped the list with $13 billion across nine deals.

BofA was one of the bookrunners of the largest rights issue by Reliance worth Rs 53,124 crore in June. The bank also exclusively advised Facebook for its stake-buy in Jio.

BofA also executed block deals for Standard Life Aberdeen (in HDFC Life and HDFC AMC) and for Blackstone in Embassy Office Parks REIT.

SBI Cards IPO, the largest initial share listing in nearly a decade, and Avenue Supermart's (DMart) QIP and OFS are some of the other big deals executed by BofA this year.

And deals continue to be worked on.

""We have a strong pipeline of deals and we are confident, the second half will be equally busy,"" Balakrishnan said.

Companies hit by the pandemic would try to sell down their non-core businesses, and it would be another opportunity for investment bankers, he added.

Balakrishnan has multiple reasons for being optimistic on the deals front.

""A lot of minority stake sale is happening across India Inc and we will see some sales driven by portfolio choice as well. You will also see quite some activity in the e-commerce space where consolidation is likely,"" he added.

In June alone, BofA handled six market transactions raising over $8.5 billion for clients. The deals included Standard Life Aberdeen selling 5.6 percent in HDFC AMC for $378 million through OFS, the RIL rights issue of $7.1 bullion, and Blackstone selling stake in Embassy Office Parks REIT for $500 million among others.

""We were the busiest i-banker on the street amid a challenging and volatile market backdrop. From the landmark $7.1 billion RIL rights issuance, which is the largest ever capital market transaction in the country to $18 million Andhra Paper OFS — we were there adding the most relevant investor colour and helping our clients access liquidity,"" he said.

According to Mergermarket, Morgan Stanley and BofA have picked nearly half of the $43.5-billion deals in H1, through just 11 of the 72 deals.

But in terms of volume, the period saw 24.7 percent fewer deals at 183 as against 243 YoY.

Morgan Stanley led the league table completing nine deals worth $13.53 billion."

Relience_Industries,16-07-2020,"Reliance seen emerging as bigger threat for US firms like Amazon, Walmart","A $20 billion fund raising spree may take India's Reliance Industries closer to its dream of becoming a digital giant, further threatening the ambitious plans US companies like Amazon, Walmart and Zoom have for India.

Stake sales in Reliance's digital unit Jio Platforms attracted not just private equity and sovereign wealth funds but also Google and Facebook, a strong endorsement for an enterprise that until a few years ago focussed largely on oil refining.

Some industry watchers equate Reliance's digital plans - which extend from online shopping and cloud computing to telecom and digital payments - to China's Alibaba and Tencent, companies Reliance itself calls ""global peers"".

Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses. With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in four years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India.

On Wednesday, billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani said Reliance will expand e-commerce platform JioMart - which connects small retailers with consumers - to offer not just groceries but also electronics and fashion goods.

""Jio Platforms not only has the backend infrastructure and development capabilities but also an ever expanding captive consumer base,"" said Mayank Vishnoi of Singapore-based financial advisory firm Resfeber International.

""The addition of new digital products targeting various sectors will pose threats to many large dominant players. Having strategic partners like Facebook and Google validates that Reliance gameplan is real.""

The recent stake sales gave Reliance a foreign partner for JioMart, which was launched this year. Facebook's WhatsApp, which counts India as its top market with 400 million plus users, will work closely in connecting small retailers to JioMart.

""We will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories,"" said Ambani.

Asked about the potential impact on foreign businesses eyeing India, one local industry executive who advises US multinationals said: ""Amazon and Walmart should be scared.""

To be sure, Reliance will face stiff competition from Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, as both companies have deep pockets and an already well-established warehousing and logistics supply chain in the country.

JioMart currently delivers groceries in only 200 cities, while Amazon and Flipkart deliver a wide range of goods across the country.

Walmart, Flipkart and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""REAL THREAT""

Reliance also has a retail footprint of around 11,000 stores across 6,700 cities that offer a wide array of products. It has also partnered with over 45 top international brands including Tiffany & Co, Burberry and Jimmy Choo.

Senior leadership at Flipkart has started keeping close tabs on Reliance, and there is a fear the Indian company will have an added advantage from the regulatory perspective, two sources close to the company told Reuters.

The Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically. Amazon and Walmart have had regulatory troubles and face far tighter government oversight in India, where the prime minister has been promoting self reliance.

Reliance's digital plans extend beyond e-commerce.

On Wednesday, the company said it will develop education and healthcare solutions via its JioMeet video conferencing tool that saw 5 million users within days of its launch this month. JioMeet has a starkly similar design to its rival, US based Zoom Video Communications.

Zoom said this month it had plans for a significant investment in India. Asked about Reliance, Zoom said it had experienced intense competition in the past but we ""know what it takes"" to become a platform of choice.

""This threat is real,"" one US tech executive in India said about Reliance. ""As of now, it's not changing the game, but that view can change in a year from now."""

But Ambani said he is committed to this partnership. Had the deal got announced it might have boosted street sentiments.

Some of the announcements which I really like are 'target to become net carbon-neutral by 2035' and another big announcement by the chairman is that Google will invest over Rs 33,000 crore in Jio Platforms.

Way ahead, Jio is ready with a world-class 5G solution and its field deployment might be carried in next year. Also, Ambani focused on Made-in-India 5G Solution.

Although, the market has discounted announcements but RIL is worth holding for mid to long term, with a target of Rs 2,600, implying 40.9 percent potential upside from current levels. Investors should try to add the stock in any healthy correction as RIL is likely to outperform the index and might lead the benchmark.

Relience_Industries,16-07-2020,"Trade Spotlight: What should investors do with RIL, Wipro and Bharti Airtel?","Indian market witnessed profit-taking at higher levels on July 16. Nifty50 failed to hold on to 10,800 levels while the S&P BSE Sensex fell more than 700 points from its highs.

Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 18 points to 36,051 while the Nifty50 closed with gains of 10 points to 10,618.

Sectorally, selling pressure was seen in telecom, energy, oil & gas, realty, and finance stocks while buying was visible in IT, FMCG, and Healthcare stocks.

Reliance Industries, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, Wipro, and NIIT Technologies were some of the stocks that were in focus.

Here is an expert's technical views on what investors who missed the price action should do:

Expert: Ashish Chaturmohta Head of Technicals and Derivatives, Sanctum Wealth Management

Reliance Industries: Likely to consolidate| Support seen at Rs 1760

The stock has been in very strong uptrend forming a higher top and higher bottom since its March low of 864. On Wednesday, it touched an all-time high of 1978 and saw profit booking.

Thus, in the near-term, the stock may see some correction towards 1760 levels, and consolidate between 1750-1950 levels.

On the upside, 1945-1978 zone needs to be crossed and sustained for the uptrend to continue towards 2125 and then towards 2200 levels. However, below 1700, a deeper correction can be seen in the stock.

Infosys: The trend remains strong| Watch out for Rs 780 on the downside

The stock has been in an uptrend forming a higher top and higher bottom since March low of 509. This week, the price has crossed the long-term falling resistance trend line connecting highs of 847 and 812.

The stock on Wednesday hit a new all-time high of 848. Thus, suggesting a change in long term trend correction mode to an uptrend.

MACD on the weekly chart has moved above the equilibrium level of zero indicating change in the ongoing trend. Hence, now crossing and sustaining above 848 levels, the stock can continue its uptrend towards the next resistance level of 950.

On the downside, 790-780 zone which was the recent breakout level will act as support as for the stock. However, a break below 780 levels, profit booking can be seen in the stock.

The stock has seen a multi-year consolidation between 220 and 545 odd levels. It has formed a base and has also seen a breakout on the upside.

The up move from the lows and breakout has been on high volumes indicating buying participation in the stock.

For the last couple of months, the stock has been consolidating gains above the breakout levels at an all-time high level.

Thus, as long as the stock holds the support level of the recent consolidation low 530, the stock is likely to see a breakout on the upside and the next resistance level is seen at 690-700. However, below 530 levels, correction can be expected in the stock.

Wipro: Uptrend to continue towards Rs 302 levels

Since its all-time high of 302 in June last year, the stock was in a downtrend to touch the low of 159. The rally from lows was facing resistance at 230 odd levels for the last few weeks.

On Wednesday, the stock witnessed a gap-up opening and continue to trend higher to form a long body bullish candle with higher volumes. Thus, indicating buying participation in the stock.

Now, the breakout has crossed the falling resistance trend line of the decline connecting the highs of 302 and 258.

Also, the price closed above the previous congestion zone of 260 and 232. Thus, sustaining above 260, the uptrends can continue towards 302 levels. On the downside, the immediate support is seen at 249 and then towards 235 levels.

NIIT Technologies: Rs 1,550 crucial support| Next target seen at Rs 1,900

The stock had seen a decline from the highs of 2059 to a low of 734. The rally from the low of 734 had been facing resistance at 1553 where 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the decline 2059-734 is seen.

The stock has formed a short-term rounding bottom between 1550 and 1300 levels. Thus, holding above the breakout level of 1,550, the stock can rally towards 1900 levels on the upside.

Relience_Industries,15-07-2020,"After the Bell: Bulls fail to hold on to 10,800 levels, what should investors do on Thursday?","Bulls failed to hold on to 10,800 levels yet again on July 15. The Nifty has now witnessed selling pressure above 10,800 in the last five out of six sessions, which suggests that it will not be easy for the bulls to surpass 10,900 in one go.

The Nifty rose to 10,830 in the first half of the trading session, led by Reliance Industries and technology companies. However, the market fell sharply in the second half on the back of profit-taking seen in RIL post its 43rd annual general meeting (AGM) and liquidation in financials

One thing is certain that the momentum seems to be fading. Bulls are not able to gather momentum above 10,800 levels or close above its 200-day moving average (DMA) placed at 10,876 levels.

As the upside from current levels looks limited in the absence of fresh triggers, analysts advise investors to remain cautious and avoid leverage bets to avoid getting caught on the wrong side.

If the index slips below 10,550-10,530, it will be an ideal level to initiate short positions, experts told Moneycontrol.

Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities, said traders should either sell Nifty at its resistance of 10,700 or if it is trading below its support level of 10,550. “Below 10530 levels, the Nifty could fall to 10,200 or 10,000 levels. On the higher side, 10,700 and 10,750 will be the major obstacles.""

We spoke to various experts and here’s what they recommend for trade on July 16:

Nifty formed a bearish candle on a daily scale as sustained supply pressure is visible at higher levels. It has also given a consolidation break down by holding below its previous weekly support of 10,650 zones.

Mechanical indicator RSI has given a negative crossover and showing a sign of profit booking decline. Now, till it holds below 10,700 zones, weakness could be seen towards 10,500-10,450 zones while immediate hurdle exists at 10,750 then 10,850 zones.

On option front, maximum put OI is at 10,000 followed by 9,000 strikes, while maximum call OI is at 11,000 followed by 11,500 strikes.

Bank Nifty opened positive and gradually extend its move towards the 21,935 mark in the first half of the session. However, it wiped out entire intraday gains of 500 points and closed below 21,500 levels.

As long as it holds below 22,000 zones, profit booking decline could be seen towards 21,000-20,800 zones.

After showing sharp weakness on July 14, Nifty witnessed high volatility today and closed the day on nominal gains of 10 points. A small negative candle was formed on July 15 with a long upper shadow. This pattern signals the instability of bulls to sustain the higher levels.

The short term trend of Nifty is weak. Wednesday's (July 15) higher levels of weakness could signal the possibility of more declines in the short term. Any intraday up moves could run into resistance.

The selling momentum is expected to be picked up on a slide below 10,550. The downside targets for Nifty to be watched around 10,350-10,300 for the next one week. Immediate resistance is placed around 10,750-10,800 for the next few sessions.

Relience_Industries,15-07-2020,"RIL AGM 2020: Reliance Industries likely to be a $400 billion company in three years, analysts say","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) will create value for shareholders in coming years given the strategic partnerships with global tech giants, experts said after company's 43rd Annual General Meeting on July 15.

Reliance Industries share price more than doubled in a span of nearly four-months and hit a record high of Rs 1,978.50 today (before seeing some profit booking), taking the total market capitalisation to $167 billion (rupee/dollar rate at 75 a dollar) and entering in the top 60 most valued companies list globally.

Given the investment by global tech giants like Facebook, Google etc., and company's focus on Jio Platforms and Retail with digitalisation and advanced technology, experts feel the total value of Reliance Industries could be over $250 billion in the next 12 months and around $400 billion in three years down the line.

""I valued Reliance Industries at $200-210 billion now which soon become more than $250 billion,"" SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18. ""$70 billion to oil-to-chemical (O2C) business, $80 billion to Jio, $40-50 billion to Retail and $10-20 billion for investment and media businesses, which total comes to $200-210 billion,"" he explained.

He sees Reliance Industries in total a $400 billion company in three years down the line, with new tech business, Jio, Retail and hiving off O2C business. ""I expect valuation of $170 billion for Jio and $100-150 billion for Retail.""

Jio Platforms has an excellent value, he said, adding, ""Reliance may keep 60-70 percent shareholding in Jio Platforms as I am hoping that Microsoft Corporation may invest in Jio, while for the time being, Retail will remain 100 percent in shareholding with Reliance which will hive off O2C business as Reliance could only be Jio and Retail in coming years.""

The key highlight of today's Annual General Meeting was the complete focus on Jio with becoming a global giant, apart from the Google's investment of Rs 33,737 crore for a 7.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms, completion of fund raising plan, readiness with a world class 5G solution with focus on exporting same, expected entry into level 4G or even 5G Smartphone industry, increase focus on JioMart, committed to deal with Saudi Aramco and focus to induct global partners/investors into Reliance Retail in next few quarters.

""Jio held center-stage at the Reliance AGM held today. The AGM marked the global view of the company in terms of investments in Jio Platforms as well as taking the lead in developing the home made 5G platform for the world,"" Ajay Khandelwal, Head PMS at Globe Capital told Moneycontrol.

He believes the AGM was a watershed event in the history of Reliance with digital services gaining precedence over the traditional Oil and Petrochemicals business. The CMD announced hiving off the O2C business into a separate company.

""These developments and the eventual demerger of the company will create a lot of value for the Reliance shareholders in coming times over medium term,"" Khandelwal said.

Viram Shah, CEO and Co- Founder at Vested Finance also said Jio has played a pivotal role in the acceleration of data adoption in the country.

""Going forward it's role is only set to become even more important. The Google partnership adds another technology offering for Jio. Now they not only provide the phone and the network, but they can also provide the operating system in the phone via the newly proposed Google and Jio joint development plans. On top of the phone, Jio will provide a gamut of services ranging from e-commerce to mutual funds to video content. Jio is on track to build a truly unique technology ecosystem, something the world might not have seen before,"" he detailed.

On the share price front, experts expect the limited upside in stock in short term given the sharp run up seen in last four months but feel the longer term remains strong and advised buying on dips.

""On the financial side, it has a health balance sheet, net debt-free status, strong management and promising growth prospects across businesses. We remain positive on the company's long term growth plans and would advise investors to hold the stock for healthy returns. Fresh investment in RIL to be made only on dips,"" Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

Today's correction (stock fell 3.7 percent) was largely a profit booking given the run up it has by more than 100 percent from March lows, as overall AGM outcome and announcements missed hopes and expectations of markets participants, said Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities who feels the upside could be limited in the short-term to around Rs 2,000-2,050.

But he advised investors to use current market price volatility to accumulate the stock as partnership deals with Facebook and Google will take time to deliver growth.

SP Tulsian feels Rs 1,750 is good support and Rs 1,800 can be good entry point. ""I expect the story of monetisation in Reliance Retail in the next six month’s time.""

Relience_Industries,15-07-2020,RIL AGM: The largest continuous fundraising by a corporate has ended. Or has it?,"When was the last time you heard Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai investing billions in the same firm and emerging as the two largest minority shareholders in the target entity?

That enticing proposition became a reality on July 15 at the 43rd — all-virtual — annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries (RIL). Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a Rs 33,737 crore investment by Google for a 7.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms, marking the end of a gargantuan, unparalleled fundraising exercise.

This is the first and biggest investment by Google under its India digitisation fund, which was launched earlier this week. The fund is looking to pump in nearly $10 billion in India over the next five to seven years and nearly half of that amount went to Jio.

On April 22, global rival Facebook invested Rs 43,574 crore to pick up a 9.9 percent stake in Jio Platforms, sealing the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Indian tech sector. Nearly half of the famed FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) stocks of the US market have now bet on the RIL subsidiary.

In less than four months, Jio Platforms has attracted a staggering Rs 152,056 crore from a total of 13 investors by shedding around 33 percent stake. These investors include Silver Lake, Vista, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton, PIF, Intel and Qualcomm.

Consequently, Jio Platforms now commands an eye-popping equity valuation of Rs 4.36 lakh crore based on the latest bet by Google, reflecting its standing as a digital powerhouse, and not just a telecom player.

“Look at the valuation and the sheer quality of names — leading strategic investors, blue-chip private equity funds and sovereign wealth funds. What else can one ask for? Some of the investors may look to exit post listing. Going forward, timing the IPO based on market conditions will be crucial,” said a capital market deals advisor on condition of anonymity.

In the past, RIL has indicated plans to list Jio Platforms in the next few years.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate has raised a combined Rs 212,809 crore through its record Rs 53,000 crore rights Issue, investments in Jio Platforms, and Rs 7,269 crore from an investment by British Petroleum in its fuel retail joint venture. The feat has no parallel in Indian corporate history.

Rs 212, 809 crore! Let that figure sink in. It’s more than one percent of India’s GDP and it was raised by RIL during the coronavirus pandemic, the most disruptive even in modern human history.

The figure far exceeds the net debt of the diversified conglomerate, which stood at Rs 1,61,035 crore at the end of March 31.

The gap would have been wider if unforeseen circumstances in the energy market had not delayed the progress of the Saudi Aramco deal. In August 2019, RIL announced plans to sell a 20 percent stake in its flagship chemicals and refining business to Saudi Aramco in a deal valued at $15 billion. But for now, the biggest takeaway for shareholders is that RIL is truly a zero net debt company, well ahead of Ambani’s initial target of March 2021.

“Our target for capital raise is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses,” Ambani said during his AGM speech.

Follow all of our coverage on RIL's 43rd annual general meeting here.

Recently, RIL crossed another milestone and became the first domestic firm to cross the Rs 12 lakh crore market capitalisation mark. From the lows of March, the share price has surged more than 100 percent.

According to a report by CNBCTV-18, it is the best performing mega-cap stock and ranks among the only non-American company in the top five best-performing stocks globally.

Market analysts have highlighted the promoter’s investor centric approach and commitment to the debt reduction exercise in a challenging market.

“RIL saw an opportunity in adversity during the lockdown period. Despite the Aramco deal getting delayed, due to the excellent infrastructure of Jio and the firm’s execution capabilities, it managed to raise more than Rs 1,52,000 crore. The record rights issue was an additional cushion and the deferred payment facility and the willingness of the promoters to subscribe to the entire issue before its closure gave confidence to investors,” said market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com.

Relience_Industries,15-07-2020,RIL AGM: The Jio-Google partnership could be a gateway to new and affordable services for Indian consumers,"Reliance Industries (RIL) announced it has partnered with Google to develop a new Android smartphone operating system for its affordable 5G smartphones in India at the company’s 43rd annual general meeting (AGM) on July 15.

Its CMD Mukesh Ambani, while making the announcement, also broke the news of Google investing Rs 33, 737 crore for a 7.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms. The partnership could be a game-changer not just for Jio and Google but for consumers as well.

Ambani revealed that the company has already sold more than 100 million Jio Phones in a short period. However, more than 350 million feature phone users remain in the country and to bring them on board, it will bring in an entry-level 4G or even 5G smartphone at a fraction of its current cost.

The telecom giant is partnering with Google to make Android's feature set accessible to these millions of feature phone users by launching affordable smartphones. The partnership is mainly focused on jointly develop an affordable smartphone with optimisations to the Android operating system.

India is the world’s second-largest market for smartphone users. While more than 550 million people have access to the internet, a large majority remain disconnected from the virtual world. The partnership with Jio will also help Google achieve its vision of providing access to people coupled with its Next Billion Users initiative.

Ambani aims at making India 2G-mukt with the Jio-Google partnership. By offering affordable 4G and 5G smartphones running on Android, the partnership will not only give millions of people access to the world of internet but also open doors to a host of new services.

For example, Google’s own family of apps, which includes the likes of Gmail, Maps, Duo, etc, will help people connect virtually and make life more convenient. Moreover, the company announced new services at the RIL 43rd AGM like the JioTV+.





RIL's partnership with Qualcomm will help bring 5G technology to the Indian market, which was previously expected to roll out in a couple of years. However, with the company further committing to bringing in 5G networks , the next-generation network is likely to be available sooner with data speeds a lot faster than the current 4G standards.

The Made-in-India 5G technology can be deployed and launched in a year once spectrum is available, said the RIL chairman on July 15. Moreover, Jio can easily upgrade its 4G network to 5G because it is an all-IP network architecture, further saving on hardware, time and costs.

My Dear Shareowners,

A very warm good afternoon to each and every one of you. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 43rd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.

Dear Shareholders,

The corona crisis is the most disruptive event in modern human history. The resultant economic crisis has compounded the global community's hardships.

However, I have no doubt India and the world will achieve faster progress, greater prosperity and a new quality of development post the Covid crisis.

And, I also strongly believe that every adversity presents multiple new opportunities. Take this AGM itself.

All of us are participating in it through our brand-new digital product – called JIOMEET. JIOMEET, since its release a few days ago has already been downloaded by more than 5 million users. It is India's first and only cloud-based video-conferencing app.

And you will be proud to know that it has been built by a young Jio Platforms team in just two months.

1. Business & Financial Performance

Dear Friends, The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2020 have already been circulated to you. With your permission, I would like to take them as read.

Reliance had yet another year of record performance. Reliance became the first Indian company to exceed market capitalisation of $150 billion. Reliance is also the first Indian company to cross ₹ 1,00,000 crore in consolidated EBITDA.

The earnings from our O2C and Upstream businesses declined due to the challenging market environment.

Yet, the consolidated performance was up 10% over the last year due to strong growth in Organized Retail and Digital Services businesses.

Our consumer businesses continued to deliver hyper growth with an EBITDA growth of 49% this year. Consumer businesses today contribute about 35% of our consolidated EBITDA. Just five years ago, nearly all of our EBITDA was from our energy and materials business.

Since then, our consumer and technology businesses have rapidly achieved scale by their exponential growth.

Dear Shareholders,

Reliance's seminal contribution to the Indian economy remains unmatched. Here are a few snapshots:

At ₹ 202,830 crore, we continue to be India's largest exporter accounting for 9.1% of India's total merchandise exports across 109 countries.

We are India's highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector with payments of over ₹ 21,660 crore. We are amongst the highest payers of GST and VAT at ₹ 69,372 crore.

We are amongst the highest payers of Income Tax in the private sector paying ₹ 8,386 crore.

Dear Shareowners,

In last year's AGM speech, I had shared my goals of growing our businesses through partnerships and achieving a Net Debt Free Balance Sheet.

I am happy to report that we have fulfilled this promise well ahead of the timelines that we had set ourselves.

In a short span of a few months, we have raised a record amount of capital and forged several new strategic partnerships.

We completed India's largest-ever ₹ 53,124 crore Rights Issue. This was also the world's largest Rights Issue by a non-financial institution in a decade. This was over-subscribed 1.59 times, setting another record in the Indian capital markets.

A unique feature of RIL's Rights Issue was that it was completed entirely on a digital platform during the lockdown period.

None of the stakeholders - regulators, bankers, financial institutions, retail investors and others - had to step out of their offices or homes for it.

This showcased India's potential to be a pioneer and an innovator in this Digital Age.

Dear Shareholders - Thank you for making the Rights Issue a phenomenal success.

Dear Friends,

Let me take a few minutes to warmly welcome our new and esteemed partners in Jio.

First, Facebook, a global technology powerhouse and a leading social media and internet company as our premier strategic partner.

After Facebook, we have investments from some of the most admired technology and financial investors - Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, TPG and L Catterton.

All of them have a long history of successfully investing in the best of technology and growth enterprises in the world. Intel and Qualcomm, who have shaped the semi-conductor industry, are at the heart of the digital ecosystems.

We will work with them to develop new products for India and Indians.

I look forward to working with each of them in a collaborative way to build on Jio Platforms' portfolio of technology and solutions.

It gives me great pleasure to welcome three of the world's largest Sovereign Wealth Funds – ADIA and Mubadala of the UAE, and PIF of Saudi Arabia – as our valued partners.

We are grateful to all our partners. What they bring is more than money. They bring faith in the Indian economy's immense growth potential.

They also bring a strong vote of confidence in our bold mission, and our ability to execute it. We look forward to working with all of them and generating value to all our stakeholders.

Dear Friends, As we end our current cycle of capital raising, we are delighted to welcome another strategic partner into Jio. A company that needs no introduction, because it is a household name in India and globally.

A company that has pioneered search engine and operating systems that are used across the world.

Let me welcome, Google to be our strategic investor in Jio Platforms. Today, we have signed a binding partnership and an investment agreement with GOOGLE… under which Google will invest ₹ 33,737 crores for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms.

This transaction is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.

With this investment by Google, strategic and financial investors have committed a total of ₹ 152,056 crore in the last few months.

We have also concluded our JV with BP in our existing fuel retailing business. BP has invested ₹ 7,629 crore for their 49% stake in the JV.

Cumulatively, we have raised a total of ₹ 212,809 crore through our Rights Issue, the combined investments in Jio Platforms, and investment by BP.

This is unprecedented in the history of capital markets in India. Indeed, there would be very few parallels globally.

This capital raise is significantly in excess of our Net Debt of ₹ 161,035 crore at the end of FY19-20. Reliance is now truly a zero Net Debt company, well ahead of my goal of March 2021.

We now have an extremely strong Balance Sheet that will support all our growth plans for our three Hyper-Growth Engines – Jio, Retail and O2C.

Our target for capital raise is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses.

2. Jio/ Digital Services

Dear Friends,

Let me start with our first Hyper-Growth Engine – JIO… our digital service initiative. I would like to first share with you the philosophy that animates Jio's current and future initiatives. The Digital Revolution marks the greatest disruptive transformation in the history of mankind.

Comparable only to the appearance of human beings with intelligence capabilities on our planet about 50,000 years ago.

It is comparable because man is now beginning to infuse almost limitless intelligence into the world around him. We are today at the initial stages of the evolution of an INTELLIGENT PLANET. Unlike in the past, this evolution will proceed with a revolutionary speed.

Our world will change more unrecognizably in just the eight remaining decades of the 21st century than today's world has changed from what it was 20 centuries ago.

For the first time in history, mankind has an opportunity to solve big problems inherited from the past. This will create a world of prosperity, beauty and happiness for all.

India must lead this change to create a better world.

For this, all our people and all our enterprises have to be enabled and empowered with the necessary technology infrastructure and capabilities.

This is Jio's purpose.

This is Jio's ambition.

Friends,

JIO is now the undisputed leader in India… With the largest customer base… the largest share of data and voice traffic…

and a world-class next-generation broadband network that covers the length and breadth of our country. As always…

We are deeply thankful and appreciative to all our customers… for their trust… and for giving us the privilege to serve and delight them every single day. This year… 2020… will forever be etched in human consciousness because of COVID-19…

Almost overnight… all of us became reliant on DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY… to stay connected… to stay healthy… and to stay productive.

I can say with pride, that during these past months… JIO has become the digital lifeline for Indians. Despite the huge surge in data traffic, JIO's network has held firm… and we continue to deliver on our promise of being an essential service provider to the nation.

Friends,

Jio's vision stands on two solid pillars. One is Digital Connectivity.

The other is Digital Platforms. We have now fully kickstarted all the FIVE ACCELERATORS of growth of DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY. ONE…

Mobile broadband.

TWO…

JIOFIBER… our optical-fiber based, Gigabit-speed HOME BROADBAND service. We have already connected over a million homes on JIOFIBER…

And our growth will accelerate as we gear up to connect millions more over the coming months in the post-COVID period.

THREE…

JIO's ENTERPRISE BROADBAND service…

In combination with powerful cloud solutions, this is enabling Indian enterprises to make rapid strides towards digital transformation… and global competitiveness.

FOUR…

BROADBAND for SMALLAND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES…

Jio's enterprise-grade voice and data services… and cloud-based solutions… are bringing Indian SMEs from zero connectivity and zero technology… to operating with the same efficiency as large connected enterprises.

And FIVE…

Jio's Narrowband Internet-of-Things – or NBIoT – service…

We use our pan-India 4G network to connect billions of smart sensors… with the highest reliability and lowest cost.

Friends,

In the next THREE years, I can see a strong path for Jio to connect Over a HALF A BILLION mobile customers; Over a BILLION smart sensors; and Over 50 million HOMES and BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS.

But, what is perhaps not so well known is that JIO's global-scale 4G and FIBER network is powered by several core software technologies and components…

that have been developed by young Jio engineers, right here in India.

And this capability and know-how that JIO has developed, positions JIO on the cutting edge of another exciting frontier – 5G.

TODAY, Friends, I have great pride in announcing… That JIO has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch.

This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India… using 100% home grown technologies and solutions.

This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available… and can be ready for field deployment next year.

And because of JIO's converged, all-IP network architecture… we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G.

Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service.

I dedicate Jio's 5G solution to our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's highly motivating vision of ‘ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT’.

Friends,

JIO PLATFORMS is conceived with this vision… of developing original, captive INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY… using which we can demonstrate the transformative power of technology across multiple Industry ecosystems … First in India…

And then confidently offering these Made-in-India solutions to the rest of the world.

Applications like MyJio and Jio SAAVN have already become household names and are used by hundreds of millions of loyal customers each month.

JIO PLATFORMS, along with its over 20 start-up partners who are now part of our family, has built significant world- class capabilities in several cutting-edge technologies…

ONE… 4G and 5G technologies TWO… Cloud Computing

THREE… Devices and Operating Systems FOUR… Big Data Analytics

FIVE… Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence SIX… Virtual and Mixed Reality SEVEN… Block Chain

EIGHT… Natural Language Understanding NINE… Computer Vision…

Using these technologies, we can create compelling solutions that span multiple Industry verticals and ecosystems… like Media…

Financial Services… New Commerce… Education… Healthcare… Agriculture… Smart Cities… Smart Manufacturing…and Smart Mobility.

These are the technologies and ecosystem solutions that hold the power to achieve 360-degree digital transformation of India.

Our start-up partners have contributed significantly to our strengths across many of these areas… And we are inviting even more start-ups to join forces with us.

Friends,

With its 100% owned Intellectual Property… total solutions approach… and the opportunity to serve a global audience…

Over the years, Reliance has built deep domain knowledge in most of the Industry verticals that are key to the Indian economy…

and JIO PLATFORMS can combine this domain expertise with its technology strengths to create multiple innovative ecosystem solutions and managed services for our country.

Each of these solutions, once proven in India, has the potential to be a global solution… that can be used to serve the rest of the world.

I am setting a goal for JIO PLATFORMS to pursue this global opportunity and to create a significant source of revenue from both the domestic and global markets.

I believe that the time has come for a truly global digital product and services company to emerge from India, and to be counted among the best in the world.

Friends....

At this point, let me pause…

and invite Isha, Akash and Kiran on to our virtual stage… to demonstrate a few of the magical solutions that JIO has been working on recently…

DEMO FOLLOWS…

Thank you Isha, Akash and Kiran… for that sampling of the exciting solutions that Jio is developing.

Friends,

Given Jio's ambitions to be a global technology, platforms and solutions company, It is important that we keep the company of the best technology enterprises in the world. Last year, we announced our partnership with MICROSOFT…

And I am happy to report that we are making rapid progress in our Azure cloud partnership.

As I mentioned to you earlier, we are privileged to enter into another strategic partnership with FACEBOOK, one of the very best technology companies in the world.

We had announced our partnership in April of this year, and we have now received all the necessary regulatory approvals.

Both Facebook and Jio share a strong vision for digitally empowering consumers as well as small businesses and entrepreneurs across India.

And now… I want to share with all of you… a message from the CEO of FACEBOOK – MARK ZUCKERBERG. Which he made at the time of the announcement of our partnership.

Transcript of Mark Zuckerberg

“Hi everyone. I know there's a lot going on around the world right now, and I hope you are all staying healthy and safe. I want to share an important update. Facebook is joining forces with a new partner in India – we're making a major financial investment, and we will become the largest minority shareholder in Jio Platforms. More than that, we're also committing to work together on some critical projects that we think will open up a lot of opportunities for commerce in India.

India is a special place for us, it's home to the largest communities around the world on Facebook and WhatsApp, and there are a lot of talented entrepreneurs. It is also in the middle of a major digital transformation that's being led by organizations like Jio that over the last four years have put hundreds of millions of Indians on to the internet. And that's a big deal, because when people get access to the internet, digital tools, they are powered to do a whole lot of new things

– learning, teaching, finding communities, people they care about, and of course starting all kinds of new businesses.

This is really important especially right now, because small businesses are at the core of every country's economy, and they need our support. India has more than 60 million small businesses and millions of people rely on them for their jobs and livelihoods. Lot of entrepreneurs now need tools they can rely on to help them find and communicate with their customers and to grow their businesses. Now, with a lot of communities around the world in lockdown, it's even more important now than ever that people have the tools to connect with each other, and their businesses can find ways to operate online. This is something that we think we can help with, which is why we are proud to be partnering with Jio to help people and businesses in India create a lot of new opportunities. We are going to share more on this soon.

So I want to thank Mukesh Ambani and the entire Jio team for your partnership. I think we are going to build a lot of great things that people find valuable in their daily lives, and importantly that make it easier to live and easier to do business. This is an important moment for all of us, and I want to personally extend a welcome to all others who want to get involved and help in this effort. We're looking forward to getting started. So, thank you and I hope you all continue staying healthy and safe.”

Thank you, MARK.

WhatsApp… which is a FACEBOOK product… is already the platform of choice for Indians and Indian businesses to connect with each other.

Over 400 million WhatsApp users in India bring unique value to our partnership.

Jio's New Commerce platform… JioMart… and Whatsapp will be working closely to create growth opportunities for millions of Indian small merchants and kirana shops…

And to ensure that consumers are able to transact seamlessly with nearby kiranas using JioMart and WhatsApp.

Friends,

Let me now talk about our partnership with Google.

From day one… it has been Jio's commitment to provide affordable 4G devices to more than 450 million feature phone users in India.

It was with this intention… that a couple of years back… we developed the JIOPHONE… which still remains the world's most affordable 4G phone.

Now… even though we have sold over 100 million JIOPHONES till date…

there are many featurephone users who are waiting… to upgrade to a conventional SMARTPHONE… if only it were somehow more affordable.

So, we have decided to address this challenge head-on.

We believe we can design entry-level 4G… or even 5G SMARTPHONE… for a fraction of its current cost.

But, to power such a value engineered smartphone, we also need an equally value-engineered smartphone operating system...and such an operating system must be designed with India in mind.

Google and Jio are partnering to build an Android-based smartphone operating system.

Through this partnership, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian.

As India is standing at the doorsteps of the 5G era, we should accelerate the migration of 350 million Indians, who currently use a 2G feature phone, to an affordable smart phone.

They should not be deprived of the benefits of the digital and data revolution. Jio is determined to make India 2G-mukt.

On this occasion… we have with us a special guest to talk about this partnership…

… the CEO of GOOGLE And a proud Indian icon…

– SUNDAR PICHAI.

Transcript of Sundar Pichai Video:

“Thanks, Mukesh, and to the entire team at Reliance Industries, for all the work you do to give millions of Indians the power to shape their destiny through technology. And thank you for the opportunity to share a few words about what our new partnership means to Google.

Getting technology into the hands of more people is a big part of Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Through this partnership with Jio Platforms we see the chance to have an even greater impact than either company could have alone.

This partnership is a key part of the next chapter of investment in India. Earlier this week we announced our Google for India Digitization Fund, an effort to invest 75,000 crore rupees or approximately $10 billion -- to accelerate India's digital economy over the next 5 to 7 years.

Our investment of $4.5 billion in Jio is the first -- and the biggest -- investment we will make through this fund. I am excited that our joint collaboration will focus on increasing access for hundreds of millions of Indians who don't currently own a smartphone...while improving the mobile experience for all.

Growing up I remember how the arrival of each new technology improved the lives of my family. Today, people in India no longer have to wait for technology to come to you. A whole new generation of technologies are happening here, first. At the same time, smartphones and affordable data have made it possible for a billion Indians to come online. Reliance, and Jio in particular, deserves a good deal of credit for this progress.

But there is more work to do to connect every Indian to the opportunities that technology creates.This goal is especially important at a time of enormous challenge for India and the world. I've never been more hopeful about India's future -- it's a future we can help shape by partnering together.

Thank you for having me. I wish you strength and good health in the months to come.”

Thank you, Sundar, for your wonderful words.

We are truly blessed to have world-class partners like Facebook, Google and Microsoft. In their company, we are even more confident of reaching the ambitious goals that we have currently identified.

And in a large market like India, I am sure we will find even more areas where we can work together.

Friends,

Our journey thus far… and our road ahead… is possible… most of all… because of the talented and passionate people who are part of the Jio Family.

And in this family, we count our employees, our strategic partners, our technology partners, our channel partners… and the many start-ups who have partnered with us.

Just a few decades back, Reliance itself was a start-up… And as a less-than 4 years old company, JIO is still very much a start-up.

As such… we have a very special place in our heart for start-ups… whom we consider our brothers-in-arms. I believe that there is no better partner for Indian start-ups than JIO. We are well positioned to help Indian start-ups in a number of ways…

Whether it be in technology development… product development… distribution… market access… or even scale-up capital…

We are ready to integrate them into our roadmap and to help them reach their full potential.

We believe that this would be the true measure of success for Jio… to create a mighty Knowledge Coalition that solves Indian problems…

and opens the doors for many more companies from India to step successfully on to the global stage.

Friends,

Together, I am confident that Jio, and this extended Jio Family… will play a leading role in India's transformation into a DIGITAL SOCIETY… and one of the leading digitally-enabled economies in the world.

Let me now present the success of our media and entertainment.

Our Network18 Group's 72 channel-strong TV broadcast network across News and Entertainment reaches more than 800 million Indians.

Our digital properties are now used by almost 200 million people every month. We are amongst the top 10 digital news players across sectors.



Organised Retail



We are consolidating our media and distribution businesses. Den and Hathway are being merged with Network18 and TV18, subject to regulatory approvals. This will make the Network18 group the largest listed media and distribution company in the country.

Dear Shareholders,

Reliance Retail has been at the forefront of bringing about the Organized Retail Revolution in India.

At the heart of our business is our relentless commitment to serve customers at scale to meet their everyday needs by providing extreme value and convenience.

We do this by partnering with farmers, small and medium-scale manufacturers, merchants, vendors, start-ups and global companies.

Last year, Reliance Retail revenues were ₹ 162,936 crore and EBITDA was ₹ 9,654 crore. We are India's largest and most profitable retail business.

Reliance Retail is the fastest growing retailer in the world, and the only Indian Retailer to feature in the Top 100 global retailers.

And we continue to be a partner of choice for marquee international brands.

I applaud the Retail team for ensuring the supply of essentials to our consumers, despite enormous constraints during the lockdown.

Dear Shareowners,

In the last five years, our revenues in the retail business have grown 8 times and our profits 11 times. This positions us well in the years ahead to continue delivering on our promise of exponential growth. Four things that give me huge satisfaction are:

First, more than two-thirds of our nearly 12,000 stores are operated in Tier II, Tier III and Tier IV towns.

Second, the deep-rooted bond with tens of thousands of farmers that has helped us source over 80% of our fresh fruits and vegetable directly from farmers.

We sell more fruits and vegetables than any other organised retailer in the country. Third, we continue to provide large employment and development opportunities for lakhs of people across India. Fourth, our growth model is based on partnership with small merchants and shopkeepers.

Dear Shareowners,

Last year, I spoke about our New Commerce initiative, JioMart.

JioMart is a tech-enabled partnership that will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.

And will reduce inefficiencies thereby creating more value for everyone in the retail ecosystem. Connecting farmers and delivering their fresh produce directly to homes is a key part of our grocery strategy. This will significantly improve farmer income and incentivise higher productivity New Commerce will transfer significant new value to consumers, producers and merchants.

I am happy to report that we are accelerating the rollout of JioMart. Currently, we have successfully piloted our JioMart grocery model with kirana partners. We are also piloting the beta version of the JioMart grocery customer online platform in 200 cities. Within a few weeks of launch, we have reached over 250,000 orders a day and the numbers continue to grow each day. JioMart is now focused on scaling its geographical reach and delivery capabilities.

JioMart is obsessed with providing convenience and a superior shopping experience to consumers.

In addition to grocery, we will expand JioMart to cover electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare in the days ahead.

In the coming years, we will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories.

Dear Shareowners,

Today the world recognizes our hyper-growth inclusive model. We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail. We will induct global partners and investors in Reliance Retail in the next few quarters.

I will keep you informed about the progress of Reliance Retail, which is at the doorsteps of continued exponential growth.

4. Oil to Chemicals And Oil and Gas

Dear Shareowners,

Now I will present our plans to transform our energy and materials businesses into a new growth engine. The year gone by, was the most challenging for global refining and petrochemical industries.

Even in this uncertain and volatile environment, our O2C business outperformed the sector and delivered an EBITDA of ₹ 55,394 crore.

Globally this year, business and consumer activity had come to a halt leading to unprecedented demand destruction and dislocation of margins.

Despite that, I am glad to report that all our manufacturing facilities continued to operate at over 90% capacity utilisation.

During India's lock-down, we leveraged our deep understanding of global markets and successfully enhanced our petrochemical and fuel exports by over 2.5 times in just two weeks.

I am proud to share with you that in April 2020, our O2C business accounted for nearly 50% of India's exports. I applaud the entire O2C Business and Manufacturing Teams for their agility and focus.

We have commissioned India's first Butyl Rubber plant, which places us amongst the world's top ten producers of Butyl Rubber.

Our O2C business has competitive feedstock streams that are the building blocks for specialty and new value chains of Acetyls, Acrylates, Phenols and Polyurethanes.

Reliance has been approached by global companies for strategic partnerships in its petrochemical business, including in utilizing these feedstocks.

These potential partnerships will help us build competitive manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to serve the deficit Indian market that still depends on large-scale imports of chemicals.

With this we will have an integrated and competitive Oil to Chemicals portfolio which is valuable to global companies as it provides access to the large and growing Indian market.

Last year, I shared with you the basis of equity investment by Saudi Aramco in our O2C business.

Due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the Covid-19 situation, the deal has not progressed as per the original timeline.

Our equity requirements have already been met.

Nevertheless, we at Reliance value our over two-decade long relationship with Saudi Aramco and are committed to a long-term partnership.

We will approach NCLT with our proposal to spin off our O2C business into a separate subsidiary to facilitate this partnership opportunity.

We expect to complete this process by early 2021.

Dear Friends,

BP is our valued partner in the Upstream Energy Business.

We expect to restart the KG-D6 towards the end of the year and provide India with Natural Gas, which is one of the cleanest fossil fuels.

We have further strengthened our relationship with BP, who have invested into our existing Fuel Retailing business under a new brand of Jio-bp.

Based on our combined strengths, Jio-bp will provide new age mobility solutions to Indian consumers.

Dear Friends,

Let me now share with you Reliance's long-term vision, beyond O2C and how we are re-imagining our entire energy platform.

Our guiding purpose is prosperity for all people and prosperity for our planet, before prosperity for energy companies.

The catastrophic impact of Climate Change calls for the legacy energy industry to reinvent itself on a war footing.

Furthermore, the world needs access to clean and affordable energy and this must be met, as it is a pre-requisite to ensuring quality of life for all people.

To meet these twin challenges, the energy industry must understand that fossil fuels and renewables are not mutually exclusive or contradictory.

The first three Industrial Revolutions based on fossil fuels disturbed the natural Carbon Cycle on Planet Earth. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has the opportunity to repair and restore the Carbon Cycle.

Here, Mother Nature is our best teacher. She wastes nothing and recycles everything.

So it is imperative that the energy industry adopts a clean, circular, sustainable and planet-friendly model that delivers green and affordable energy to all the 7.8 billion people on the planet.

This is what will drive our progress towards a cleaner planet for a safer humanity. This can be achieved by making CO2as a recyclable resource, rather than treating it as an emitted waste.

While Reliance will remain a user of crude oil and natural gas, we are committed to embracing new technologies to

convert our CO2 into useful products and chemicals.

We have already made substantial progress on photosynthetic biological pathways to convert our CO2 emissions at Jamnagar into high value proteins, nutraceuticals, advanced materials and fuels.

We will develop next-gen carbon capture and storage technologies. We are evaluating novel catalytic and electrochemical transformations to use CO2 as a valuable feedstock.

Reliance also has proprietary technology to convert transportation fuels to valuable petrochemical and material building blocks. And at the same time, we will replace transportation fuels with clean electricity and hydrogen.

We will combine our strengths in digital, power electronics, advanced materials and electrochemistry to build full stack electrolyser and fuel cell solutions in India.

We will build an optimal mix of reliable, clean and affordable energy with hydrogen, wind, solar, fuel cells and battery.

Transforming our energy business to tackle one of the biggest challenges before India and the World is our new growth opportunity.

On successful implementation of this strategy, we target to become net carbon-zero by 2035.

We have a 15-year vision to build Reliance as one of the world's leading NEW ENERGY and NEW MATERIALS COMPANY.

It will be a platform company which will execute our vision in a worldwide collaborative model.

This model envisages a large coalition of global financial investors, reputed technology partners, and start-ups working on futuristic solutions.

The New Energy business based on the principle of Carbon Recycle and Circular Economy is a multi-trillion opportunity for India and the world.

It is also an opportunity to make clean and green energy abundantly available at an affordable price to every Indian, every Indian enterprise and every Indian utility.

More than a business, this is our seva to save Planet Earth from the ravages of Climate Change. We shall spare no effort in realising this dream.

From time to time, I shall apprise you of our progress in this business

5. Reliance Foundation and Reliance Family's Crusade Against Covid-19

Dear Friends, Let me now welcome Nita to talk about Reliance Foundation. Thank you, Mukesh.

Esteemed shareholders,

Namaskar.

As I speak to you for the first time ever in a Reliance AGM, I feel a profound sense of humility and gratitude. All of us have witnessed the unprecedented pain, uncertainty, and suffering that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing.

That is why, Mukesh and I decided that we should do all that we can, in performing our humanitarian, patriotic, and collective duty in this hour of national need.

It is my privilege to share with you some of the work that the Reliance Family has done in the past four months – and continues to do so, each day and every hour:

First: Within days of the Coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first 100-bed exclusive COVID-19 Hospital in Mumbai, in just two weeks.

Today, this facility has 250 beds.

Our brave-heart doctors and nurses have been working selflessly and tirelessly in service of our fellow Indians.

In your work, humanity has placed their hope and faith.

With folded hands, I express my deep gratitude to all healthcare workers who have dedicated themselves to fighting this battle!

I would like to share with you a few glimpses of the exemplary efforts of our front-line warriors… When the pandemic broke out, one of the earliest challenges was the shortage of PPEs.

It was critical to protect our healthcare workers and provide them with the right armour so that they could fight valiantly at the forefront!

In record time, we turned around our manufacturing facility to produce over 1 lakh PPEs and N95 masks every single day.

And that too at one third the price of imported PPEs, as we remain committed to the “Make In India” mission.

That's not all. Every business in the Reliance Family has done their bit and contributed to India's fight against COVID-19.

The team at Reliance Retail is working overtime to provide essential supplies daily to millions of Indian families across 200 cities.

Jio is providing digital connectivity to over 40 crore individuals, empowering over 30,000 organizations to work from home……… and lacs of students to learn from home.

Reliance has also been providing free fuel to Emergency Service vehicles across the country.

This is not just business for us.

It is our duty, our dharma, our seva to the nation. That brings me to another form of Seva, which is closest to my heart. Reliance Foundation's Mission Anna Seva – our pledge to feed needy Indians. In our culture, Anna Daan is Maha Daan.

Through Mission Anna Seva, we have provided more than 5 crore meals to marginalised communities, daily-wage earners, and frontline workers across the country.

We are humbled that our Mission Anna Seva has become the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world.

This would not have been possible without the untiring efforts and dedication of the entire team of Reliance Foundation, and all our volunteers and partner organizations.

We are also grateful to our two lakh employees of Reliance who have gone beyond their call of duty, to serve our fellow citizens.

This has been a deeply fulfilling journey for all of us.

Friends,

The war against coronavirus is far from over.

Reliance Foundation is gearing up to partner with the government and local municipalities, for mega-scale COVID testing across India, with the help of Jio's digital infrastructure.

And I assure you, as soon as the corona vaccine becomes available, we will volunteer by using the same digital distribution and supply chain, to ensure that the vaccine reaches every nook and corner of our country…….

For Mukesh and me, being of service to our nation has given us a deep sense of satisfaction.

We are so proud of our Reliance Family's contribution to India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and their efforts to help alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters.

Please join me in applauding and saluting…

All our doctors, nurses, medical personnel and staff of Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital and other Reliance Foundation hospitals;

All scientists and researchers at Reliance Life Sciences; All teams at Reliance Foundation; And all our colleagues at Reliance Retail and Jio; You have made RELIANCE proud, INDIA proud.

Friends,

This year, Reliance Foundation is celebrating its 10th year of 'Transforming Lives' across India.

Over the last decade, our Foundation has touched the lives of over 36 million people, in the remotest corners of our country.

As the Foundation enters its next decade, my daughter Isha and her young team are determined to enhance our scale and impact – more than ten times.

Using Jio's digital power, we aim to make affordable healthcare and quality education accessible to every Indian. Along with education, sport forms the bedrock of any society, especially a young society like ours.

Children have a special place in my heart. When children learn and play, communities grow and countries prosper.

Through our Education and Sports for All initiative, Reliance Foundation has so far reached out to over 21.5 million children.

Right from grassroots level – we are working tirelessly to develop a holistic sporting ecosystem in the country. An ecosystem that will scout, nurture, train, and develop future champions!

It is my dream to see our athletes excel at the pinnacle of global sport – The Olympics. It is also my dream to bring the Olympics to India.

I believe in our youth. And I have no doubt that if we encourage and empower them, they will make these dreams come true and make our country proud. Dear Shareholders,

For all of us at Reliance, the work of Reliance Foundation is a source of tremendous joy, pride, and fulfilment.

For us, the ability to make a difference – big or small – to touch someone's life for the better, is more precious than anything else.

Whenever India has faced any adversity, we Indians have always overcome it with absolute unity and determination.

This crisis will be no different. Together, we can and we will win this fight. And come out stronger as a nation.

Keep well. Keep safe. Jai Hind!



Value Creation and Conclusion



Thank you, Nita for highlighting how Reliance Foundation is a caring and compassionate institution always ready to serve the nation.

Dear Shareowners,

Let me now share with you Reliance's future Value Creation Roadmap. Our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani gave us a mantra that continues to guide us in our value creation journey. He said “GROWTH IS LIFE”, which we have adopted as our motto.

He also constantly reminded us that, for happiness, growth should be holistic, enriching the life of every Indian and developing every aspect of human life.

Walking in his footsteps, Reliance has constantly reinvented itself to pursue ever higher growth goals.

And with each new growth cycle, we have demonstrated our commitment to create more prosperity for India and benefit more Indians.

In 2020, we all can be proud that today Reliance stands stronger than ever before. This is because, as a Technology and Consumer Company, Reliance has built three Hyper-Growth Engines… Jio Platforms business.

Reliance Retail's New Commerce business. Reliance's O2C business.

In the years to come, Reliance will create more growth engines for accelerating its diversified growth.

Among them, as I have already mentioned, is our vision to make Reliance a New Energy and New Materials Company.

Our growth strategy is aimed at meeting the needs of all the 1.3 billion Indians. Especially, the millions of under-privileged people, who are at the Bottom of the Economic and Social Pyramid. So far, India's growth has been sustained by the demands of a small part of our enviable demographic strength. But when 'Bharat' and 'India' start growing together, the whole world will be astonished.

When we create value for our nation's inclusive future, its automatic by-product is value accretion for Reliance.

Dear Shareowners,

We are well aware that we cannot realise this vision on our own. Indeed, no single company can.

Therefore, we are adopting a strategy of two Ps –

Partnerships with millions of small merchants, kisans, SMEs, teachers, healthcare workers, helping them become more productive and profitable.

Also, Partnerships with promising Indian start-ups and globally renowned technology and energy companies. Intellectual property is going to be an important pillar of our value creation journey.

Therefore, Reliance will continue to strengthen its in-house capabilities in cutting-edge technological innovations. Towards this end, we will work more aggressively to attract the best young Indian talent.

Reliance will work with other Indian companies, including start-ups, to vigorously promote “Made-in-India”, “Made-for-India” and “Made-for-the-World” products.

Dear Shareholders,

As Reliance grows bigger, we have demonstrated our ability to raise necessary investments to fire our growth engines.

Now, on the back of our robust balance sheet, and taking advantage of the favourable conditions in global debt markets, we shall confidently pursue all future growth opportunities across our businesses.

Our track record of value creation so far will itself open future tracks of investment on a sustainable basis.

Dear Shareholders,

Reliance has travelled three years into its Golden Decade. What an incredible journey it has been since our IPO in 1977. Our market capitalization has increased at a CAGR of 31%.

Reliance is now ranked among the World's 60 largest companies by market capitalization.

And when Reliance scales still higher summits of success, our employees and shareholders will surely reap its rewards.

Dear Shareholders,

Reliance's 50th anniversary in 2027 coincides with the 80th anniversary of India's Independence. This is not a coincidence.

It shows the intrinsic relationship between New Reliance and New India.

Today I want to solemnly pledge that we are ever more committed to maximising our contribution to solving the big problems facing our Nation and also our Planet.

Dear Friends,

Before I conclude, I must share my deepest emotion with you.

These are difficult times, no doubt, for India and the world because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, never have I felt more optimistic in my life about a bright future for India, and for Reliance.

When I interact with young entrepreneurs, engineers and innovators, both in Reliance and in other enterprises, I clearly see in them a level of ambition and self-confidence far higher than in people of my generation.

They surely are going to make the Indian Dream come true. They strengthen my conviction that INDIA'S TIME HAS WELLAND TRULY COME!

Our visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has rightly predicted that, beyond the hardships of the corona crisis, India will emerge as a stronger, more inclusively prosperous, more resilient and more self-confident nation.

Let us work together to realise this noble goal.

For all of us at Reliance, the source of inspiration is Swami Vivekananda, who said: “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.”

Speaking at the RIL 43rd AGM, Isha Ambani said the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a fundamental shift in perspectives about health.

Reliance Industries (RIL) said through its Jio Platform applications JioMeet and JioHealthHub, the company will be offering end-to-end digital healthcare services.

Isha Ambani said the digital healthcare, comprises of three core pillars.

First is the strong Jio 4G mobile network and Jio Fibre Broadband provides connectivity required for high quality video calls.

Second will be the Jio Meet platform enabling seemless video consultations between patients and doctors and third is JioHealthHub providing end-to-end healthcare services.

""With our health platform, we are integrating overall healthcare ecosystem to enable people to book online consultations, securely store and share health records, book labs tests and avail various other healthcare services,"" Isha Ambani said.

In addition to grocery, RIL said it we will expand JioMart to cover pharmaceutical and healthcare in the days ahead.

JioMart is an online grocery delivery service, started as a joint venture between Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms.

RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said as soon as the corona vaccine becomes available, the organisation will volunteer by using the same digital distribution and supply chain, to ensure that the vaccine reaches every nook and corner of our country.

""In record time, we turned around our manufacturing facility to produce over 1 lakh PPEs and N95 masks every single day. And that too at one third the price of imported PPEs, as we remain committed to the “Make In India” mission,"" Ambani said.

Relience_Industries,10-07-2020,Mukesh Ambani pips Warren Buffett to emerge 8th richest in the world,"India's richest man and CMD of Reliance Industries Mukesh Ambani has overtaken Warren Buffett to become the eighth richest man, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Ambani's wealth is now worth $68.3 billion, surpassing Buffett’s $67.9 billion as of July 9, Bloomberg reported.

RIL shares have gained 21.63 percent in 2020, at a time when businesses have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, on the issuance of partly paid-up equity shares and stake sale of 25.09 percent in its digital arm -- Jio Platforms -- to marquee global investors such as Facebook , General Atlantic, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, KKR and Mubadala Investment Company, ADIA, TPG Capital, L Catterton, PIF and Intel Capital.

The company has become debt-free much ahead of its March 2021 target. It had also received $1 billion from BP for 49 percent stake in Jio-BP venture to set up thousands of petrol stations across India to tap the booming energy demand.

Ambani is the only Asian tycoon in the exclusive club of the world’s top 10 richest people last month, which began in 2012. Warren Buffett’s wealth dropped this week after he gave away $2.9 billion in charity.

The report said that the 89-year-old, known as the Oracle of Omaha, has slipped down the rankings after he gave away more than $37 billion of Berkshire Hathaway shares since 2006. The Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has underperformed this year and is down 20.65 percent.

The report added that the country has emerged as a hot-spot for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) this year, accounting for more than 12 percent of those announced in Asia Pacific -- the highest ratio since at least 1998, thanks to investments in Jio."
Relience_Industries,08-07-2020,Upside for Indian rupee seen limited despite multiple positives,"India's rupee has the backing of a healthier trade account, steady foreign investment inflows and a return in global risk appetite, but its gains are being limited by a central bank keen to prevent wild swings and build dollar reserves.

The Reserve Bank of India's stated foreign exchange policy has been to only curb extreme volatility but recent actions suggest it is not letting the local unit appreciate despite its relative underperformance versus peers.

Traders suspect the RBI bought dollars in May and June as the return in risk appetite and overseas investments by a dozen firms, including Facebook, into the digital arm of telecommunications firm Reliance Jio brought in billions of dollars into the country.

Reliance is scheduled to get a total of $15.8 billion, part of which has already come in. India's external account has also improved owing to the sharp fall in global crude oil prices and a collapse in imports in an economy weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies have raised $2.49 billion through external commercial borrowings in April and May.

The flows coming in are only temporary and cannot be taken for granted as a recovery in growth would push up imports and widen the current account deficit eventually, said Suyash Choudhury, head of fixed income at IDFC AMC.

""It is also in this context that we see RBI's more aggressive stance in accumulating forex reserves lately. It is prudent to shore up external defenses given the long haul ahead.""

The rupee was at 74.98 to the dollar on Wednesday and is down 4.74 percent so far this year, making it the worst performing Asian currency.

The RBI's foreign exchange reserves have climbed to a record above $500 billion and are now adequate to cover around 13 months of imports, far higher than the average over the last 5 years.

The rupees released by the RBI's dollar buying intervention are adding to the cash circulating in the banking system. There is, however, little evidence the RBI has mopped up that excess cash, and clearing house data shows state-run banks are ploughing more money into government bonds.

The RBI is, however, expected to purchase government bonds either directly or via open market bond purchases to help tame market yields and ensure the government is able to meet its record borrowing needs.

Rahul Gupta, head of currency research at Emkay Global Financial Services, sees the range around 74.20-74.30 becoming a floor for the dollar-rupee pair, and expects it to head towards 76.20 or 77.00 within a couple of months.

""The government's stimulus also needs to be financed from somewhere, imports also will start rising as the economy recovers and we will again start seeing pressure on the currency,"" he said."
Relience_Industries,07-07-2020,Nomura sees COVID-19 risk to earnings but is bullish on these 5 largecaps,"India now has more than 7.2 lakh confirmed coronavirus infections, the third-highest in the world, and over 20,000 deaths.

The country has been adding more than 20,000 cases each day since July 3, a spike that experts say poses a major risk to earnings and growth as it will come in the was the full capacity utilisation. Adding to the problem is that hot spots or the worst-hit areas are in major revenue spinner states like Maharashtra and Delhi.

""Given the high rate of spread of infection at around 10 percent, which should be below 7 percent consistently to prevent an increase in active cases, restrictions are likely to remain in place at least in the hotspots,"" Japanese brokerage firm Nomura said, adding risk to earnings remained.

The Nifty consensus earnings estimates for FY21 and FY22 are down 27 percent and 16 percent, respectively, since the start of FY20.

In early June, Nomura had estimated 17/9 percent cuts in FY21/FY22 consensus earnings estimates, ""and since then we have witnessed 9/5 percent cuts in Bloomberg consensus”, it said.

Economic activity across sections has improved since late May. There has been a month-on-month increase in sales and the major support has come from rural areas, as agriculture has largely remained unaffected by the outbreak. Infections are high in urban areas and companies are not using their full capacity due to social distancing norms.

""On consumption, we find stable sales of staples and a pick-up in certain discretionary segments. One consistent feedback from companies has been stronger growth in rural areas compared to urban,"" said Nomura.

""The reported recovery data needs to be seen against the backdrop of pent-up demand, higher economic activity during the start-up phase (only around 40 percent of the economy was functional during lockdown) and higher inventory stocking by businesses and households. Seen in this context, the data thus far does not inspire confidence. Therefore, the recovery is not reflective of underlying demand,"" it added.

To an extent, near term-earnings are supported by pent-up demand, low raw-material costs, lower discretionary expenditure and no material increase in credit costs (moratorium impact).

""With reversal in some of these factors and slower economic growth, there are risks to further cuts in earnings estimates. At present the market is factoring in 21 percent earnings CAGR over FY20-22F, which compares to 6 percent CAGR over FY15-20,"" the brokerage said.

Nomura is selective in sectors and stocks, with preference for exporters, rural consumption and companies likely to gain market share through the crisis.

Its top picks are Reliance Industries, Lupin, HCL Technologies, Mahindra & Mahindra and ICICI Bank, all rated ""buy"".

The Nifty50 has rallied 22 percent since May 18, and in this period India has been an outperformer in the regions and among EMs.

""We see this as a catch-up rally, as the Indian market was a significant underperformer over February to March, with relentless FII selling in March 2020. In this rally, domestic cyclicals have outperformed defensives. After this rally, the Nifty 50 is trading at 19.8x 1-yr forward earnings, the highest in the past decade,"" Nomura said. The earnings outlook remains challenging, it said.

FIIs net sold Rs 89,069.01 crore worth of shares in India during January-April, including Rs 65,816.7 crore of highest ever monthly outflow in March, but they turned net buyers in May-June.

Overall, the Nifty and the Sensex have gained 41 percent from the lows of March 23, with leading sectors gaining in the range of 32-55 percent.

""We believe the market is looking beyond FY21 earnings, and on two-year forward basis, the market is at 15.6x, above the long-term average of 14.4x. The spread between earnings yield and bond yield has narrowed, and is now within fair value zone, in our assessment,"" Nomura said.

On July 6, the m-cap of the stock stood at Rs 11,73,677.35 crore on BSE.

On April 22, when the company announced Facebook's Rs 43,574-crore investment in Jio Platforms for a 9.99 percent stake, the m-cap was Rs 7.83 lakh crore. In just 11 weeks, the stock's m-cap surged by over Rs 3.9 lakh crore.

At a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hit businesses hard, RIL has remained resilient and became debt-free much ahead of its March 2021 target.

Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries is the only Indian company to feature on a list of businesses that prospered during the coronavirus enforced lockdown.

A list of top 100 companies by London' Financial Times ranked Mumbai-based RIL at 89. The publication ranked companies based on resilience during the pandemic.

The company has raised a combined Rs 117,588.45 crore from some of the world’s leading tech investors led by Facebook for a stake in its digital arm, Jio Platforms.

The company's last deal was with chipmaker Intel for a 0.39 percent stake, valued at Rs 1,894.5 crore.

This was Jio's twelfth deal in 11 weeks, following investments from Facebook Inc, General Atlantic, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, KKR and Mubadala Investment Company, ADIA, TPG Capital, L Catterton and PIF.

The Intel deal took to 25.09 percent the stake that Reliance has sold in Jio Platforms.

In the last three months, the stock has witnessed healthy traction because of the positive news around several deals and the company being debt-free.

On June 19, the company said it was debt-free and had raised over Rs 1.68 lakh crore in just 58 days.

In 2020, the stock is up 20 percent against a 12 percent fall in the benchmark Sensex.

Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities, is of the view that a large part of these developments had already played out but for those still looking for outperformance, Reliance was the pick.

Most experts believe the stock can touch Rs 2,000-mark by the end of the year and has the potential for re-rating.

Stock market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18 that the stock may see a big re-rating.

Deven Choksey of KRChoksey Securities, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, said the same, foreseeing the year-end price of the stock over Rs 2,000.

The rise of stock will heavily depend on the Jio Platforms.

Reliance Industries was no longer an energy play but a technology play and the market cap of Rs 12 lakh crore by the end of the year was on the cards, Bhasin said.

""The stock is in a very sweet spot. Data is the new gold and that will continue to play for some time. Our Diwali target for the stock remains at Rs 2,000,"" he said.

Jio Platforms, he said, may get listed outside India to fetch better valuation but that will happen when the market will seem to have accepted it.

""Right now, they will wait for stability and will concentrate on garnering more market share and increasing the ARPU. By March 2021, there will be time for a good listing of Jio Platforms,"" Bhasin said.

Shankar Sharma, Vice-Chairman and joint MD of First Global told CNBC-TV18 that the valuation of Jio was low and unjustified and it deserved a valuation of about half-a-trillion dollar.

""My personal view is that $60-65 billion for a business of this size and scale that Jio is, and $50-60 billion have been invested in it in the last 9-10 years, a $60-65 billion valuation is nothing at all. Jio should get a valuation that is closer to half-a-trillion,"" Sharma said.

Amar Deo Singh, Head-Advisory of Angel Broking is bullish on Reliance.

""With the possibility of the JIO platform getting listed abroad not ruled in the future, the exciting times of Reliance are here to stay. The stock, after making a low of Rs 867.82 on March 23, 2020, has jumped a spectacular 113 percent in three months. Stay invested in Reliance,"" Singh said.

""In the last three months, several deals were struck and the company became debt-free, leading to a significant increase in investor appetite for the stock coupled with re-rating by many brokerage firms. Now, Reliance is no longer an energy play but has become a tech play, with data becoming the new oil. Also, with the breakneck pace of digitalization post-COVID-19, Reliance becomes a major beneficiary, well poised to capture a significant pie of the online business,"" said Singh.

Singh believes the further rise of the stock will depend heavily on the performance of the JIO platform.

Relience_Industries,04-07-2020,"Coronavirus impact | Indian billionaires take a knock, have a slow year","Businesses of India’s richest continued to slow down—and resultantly their net worth eroded—in an economy which is growing at its slowest in 11 years, hurt by poor consumption demand.

The collective wealth of India’s billionaires, according to the Forbes World Billionaires 2020 List, contracted 22.8 percent to $312.6 billion from $405.3 billion a year earlier. Forbes calculated net worth based on stock prices and exchange rates as on March 18.

Reliance Industries’ (RIL) owner Mukesh Ambani continued to hold his position as India’s richest, but saw his wealth fall by over 25 percent to $36.8 billion, from $50 billion last year due to stock market collapses and global oil fluctuations. (RIL is the owner of Network 18, publisher of Forbes India.)

However, Ambani has since stormed back into the top 10 of the Forbes real-time Billionaires Index (as of June 26), on the back of 11 large investments into its telecom subsidiary Jio Platforms, which has led to a surge in the RIL stock price and helped make it debt-free.

At least 15 billionaires from the list have seen a growth in net worth from last year. Radhakishan Damani jumped to become the second richest Indian billionaire from seventh in 2019 (net worth up by 24 percent to $13.8 billion), through his Avenue Supermarts which owns and operates the DMart chain of hypermarkets.

Other gainers include Sunil Mittal, whose net worth rose by 35 percent to $8.8 billion in the list, as its telecom service Bharti Airtel has emerged a force to reckon with. Industrialist Gautam Adani, who leads the diversified Adani Group, food and beverages tycoon Ravi Jaipuria and Shree Cement founder Benu Gopal Bangur also gained in net worth from the previous year.

Once math tutor and now entrepreneur Byju Raveendran (in picture) debuts on the list (53rd richest Indian and ranked 1,196) on the back of sharp growth of his edtech unicorn Byju’s. According to the list, the company is valued at $8 billion and Raveendran, India’s youngest billionaire at 38, at $1.8 billion. (In June-end, Byju’s raised about $100 million from Silicon Valley investor Bond Capital, sending its valuation soaring at around $10.5 billion.)

The net worth of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, India’s second richest billionaire as per the 2019 list, has fallen 73 percent to $6.1 billion and rank to tenth, as he has been giving away most of his wealth to his charity foundation.

The number of India’s dollar billionaires in the list fell by four to 102, which included Ambani’s younger brother Anil (75th Indian and 1,349 on the 2019 list). Anil Ambani has seen his businesses crumble, with RCom filing for bankruptcy last year. Media tycoon Subhash Chandra (51st Indian and 916 in 2019) has also fallen off due to debts.

For some, stock market fortunes and business cycles continue to be harsh. Former Yes Bank shareholders Rana Kapoor and Madhu Kapur; Tarang Jain, owner of auto-part maker Varroc, and Max Group’s chairman Analjit Singh, who had dropped out in 2019, have not climbed back onto the list. The current fiscal is bound to throw up more unpleasant news. The impact of COVID-19 has only worsened since the list was published and it will hurt valuations of companies more in the coming quarters.

Post March’s vertical fall, Nifty continued its volatile ride, the index settled the penultimate session for June series at 10,290. Nifty and Bank Nifty gained 8.5 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively, on (eoe basis). However, profit taking encountered near 61.8 percent retracement (i.e. 10,550).

Despite the recent setback from 200-EMA & presence of multiple Gann numbers, the structure of Nifty continues to be bullish, trading above the support of upward sloping trendline on the daily chart. Nifty and Bank Nifty gained 8.4 percent and 12.3 percent on expiry to expiry basis.

In the June series, leadership was driven by Reliance Industries marking fresh life high levels with strong buildup and comeback of laggards from NBFC and financial space. VIX remained at lower band throughout the series near 30-mark. Two consecutive months of large negative cost of carry for Nifty index making short rolls unviable.

Rollovers for Nifty and Bank Nifty stood at 79 percent (1.14 crore shares) and 81 percent (13 lakh shares), respectively, against 76 percent (1 crore shares) and 81 percent (14.3lakh shares), respectively, previous month. Higher rolls with hint of long buildup on heavy weight index stocks. In June series, Rollcost on Nifty remained negative ~(-42 points) to long rollers during expiry day.

Funds flows also remained sharply volatile as periodic shift in sentiment seen due to global and domestic factors. Index futures long/short ratio stood at ~.7x levels for start of July series, while FIIs turned buyers in cash segment in past couple of days. Positioning on the index remained strong as heavy weights, likes of Reliance Industries and Hindustan Unilever, select banking stocks holding ground with strong traction from traders suggesting buy on dips approach will work for Index.

US markets remained jittery as sharp retracement seen after large gains in past couple of days, key levels to watch 24,900 on Dow and 2,950 on S&P500 in near term breaking and sustaining below the same likely to keep bears active with mild periodic short covering, CBOE global VIX remained stubborn near 30 mark seen multiple bottom near it, expected to remain elevated in near term. India VIX remained largely sideways with no major panic seen even on significant down days.

On options front, July series starts with the buildup on monthly series 10,000 put strike holding ~2 million shares while on call 10.5k strike holding ~1.7million shrs, Scattered buildup on options indicates wide trading range participants betting on while near term we expect trading band of 10,100 to 10,500 for Nifty. However, joker on the pack remains directional moves on Bank Nifty as 22,000 hurdle is getting tough for Bank Nifty bulls to break above, until it sustains above 22k mark fresh leg of upside looks difficult for broader markets as well.

Bank Nifty continued its overall under-performance (this year it’s down by 33 percent against Nifty’s 15 percent decline). Weekly options data for July 2 indicates consolidation for the markets with downside support seen at 10,100 mark and upside capped near 10,400 levels.

PSU stocks showing signs of revival along with metals while pharma stocks continue to show signs of momentum going into long July series, setup indicates Nifty to remain volatile while dips towards 9,950-10,000 mark likely to act as strong support zone for July series. Profit taking encountered near 61.8 percent retracement (i.e. 10,550) of the entire previous decline, hence a decisive breakthrough above 10,550 is essential for gaining further momentum on the upside.

@CCI_India approves acquisition of 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms by Jaadhu Holdings LLC.

— CCI (@CCI_India) June 24, 2020

Social media giant Facebook on April 22 announced its plan to purchase a stake in Jio Platforms for $5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore). The much-talked-about deal gives it a firm foothold in India's fast-growing digital market while also helping the Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate significantly cut its debt.

For Facebook, India has in recent years emerged as a critical market. The company has more users in India than any other country. Its WhatsApp chat service, which has attracted 340 million users and is about to launch a key payments service will take on incumbents Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe and Amazon Pay.

Since its deal with Facebook, Jio Platforms has attracted a series of investments from players like General Atlantic, Silver Lake (twice), Vista Equity Partners, KKR, Mubadala Investment Company, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton and Saudi Arabia's PIF have queued up for investments in Jio.

With its latest deal with PIF, RIL has shed 24.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms and has raised Rs 115,693.95 crore from some of the world’s top technology investors.

Relience_Industries,23-06-2020,Working to complete contours of Saudi Aramco deal: Mukesh Ambani,"Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Tuesday said it is working to complete contours of a $15-billion deal with Saudi Aramco but did not give a timeline for its completion.

Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani in August last year announced talks for sale of 20 percent stake in the oil-to-chemical (O2C) business, which comprises its twin oil refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat and petrochemical assets, to the world's largest oil exporter. The deal was to be concluded by March 2020 but has been delayed.

""Reliance is working to complete the contours of a strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" Ambani said in the firm's latest annual report without giving timelines.

The partnership with Aramco would give Jamnagar refineries ""access to a wide portfolio of value-accretive crude grades and enhanced feedstock security for a higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" he said.

Reliance executed on the next phase of its growth journey in 2019-20, forging transformative partnerships across businesses.

""Reliance and Aramco share a common outlook and vision on the evolution of the business in the future with emphasis on higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" the firm said in the annual report.

Also, the firm said it has formed a 51:49 joint venture with BP plc of the UK for automobile and aviation fuel business in India.

With a stake, Aramco would not just have a stake in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and offering a potentially bigger downstream role in future.

Besides refineries and petrochemical plants, the O2C business also comprises 51 percent stake in the fuel retailing business. It, however, does not include the upstream oil- and gas-producing assets such as the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.

RIL's refineries are one of the most complex in the world, allowing it to earn a significant premium to the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin. Its petrochemical complexes rank among the biggest in the world, whose dependency on outside raw materials is minimal. RIL has leadership positions both in the domestic polymer and polyester markets."
Relience_Industries,23-06-2020,No salary hike for RIL's Mukesh Ambani for 12th consecutive year; Here's how much he earned last year,"Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani has kept his annual salary from his flagship firm Reliance Industries capped at Rs 15 crore for 12th year on the trot in the fiscal ended March 31 and has thereafter decided to forego the entire remuneration in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ambani has kept salary, perquisites, allowances and commission together at Rs 15 crore since 2008-09, forgoing over Rs 24 crore per annum.

This is at a time when remunerations of all whole-time directors of the company, including cousins Nikhil and Hital Meswani, saw a handsome increase in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

""In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in India, which has exacted a huge toll on the societal, economic and industrial health of the nation, Mukesh D. Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director, has voluntarily decided to forego his salary,"" the company said in its latest annual report.

The Board of Directors noted his decision to forego salary until the impact of COVID-19 abates, it said.

Ambani decided to forego his remuneration at end-April when the company decided to cut the salary of most of its employees by 10-50 percent.

""The Chairman and Managing Director had his salary capped at Rs 15 crore since 2008-09 in order to set a personal example of moderation in managerial compensation levels. And now, he is forgoing his salary until the company and all its businesses are fully back to their earnings potential,"" the company said in the annual report for 2019-20.

On a similar note, other executive directors have also expressed their decision to draw remuneration up to 50 percent of their remuneration entitlement, it said.

Ambani's remuneration for 2019-20 included Rs 4.36 crore as salary and allowances, which is marginally lower than Rs 4.45 crore he got in the previous 2018-19 fiscal.

Commission has been unchanged at Rs 9.53 crore while perquisites have risen to Rs 40 lakh from Rs 31 lakh. Retirement benefits were Rs 71 lakh.

Ambani's cousins Nikhil R Meswani and Hital R Meswani saw their compensation rise to Rs 24 crore each from Rs 20.57 crore a year back. They earned Rs 19.99 crore each in 2017-18 and Rs 16.58 crore in 2016-17. In 2015-16, Nikhil had got Rs 14.42 crore while Hital took home Rs 14.41 crore. In 2014-15, they had got Rs 12.03 crore each.

Also, one of his key executives, Executive Director P M S Prasad saw his remuneration go up to Rs 11.15 crore from Rs 10.01 crore in the previous year. He too has seen his remuneration rise steadily -- from Rs 6.03 crore in 2014-15, to Rs 7.23 crore in the next fiscal, Rs 7.87 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 8.99 crore in the year thereafter.

Refinery chief Pawan Kumar Kapil saw his compensation fall to Rs 4.04 crore from Rs 4.17 crore.

RIL's non-executive directors, including Nita Ambani, got Rs 1.15 crore each as commission, besides sitting fees. The commission is lower than Rs 1.65 crore paid in the previous fiscal. The commission was Rs 1.5 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 1.3 crore in the year prior to that.

Ambani's wife Nita Ambani, a non-executive director on the company's board, earned Rs 7 lakh as sitting fee, unchanged from the previous year. Apart from Ambani, the RIL board has Meswani brothers, Prasad and Kapil as wholetime directors.

Besides Nita Ambani, other non-executive directors include Mansingh L Bhakta, Yogendra P Trivedi, Dipak C Jain, Raghunath A Mashelkar, Adil Zainulbhai, Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji and former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya.

Bhakta ceased to be a director in August last year and was replaced by former CVC K V Chowdary."
Relience_Industries,23-06-2020,"'Up move in BFSI sector can take Nifty above 11,000; bet on consumption story'","If Nifty50 has to go closer to 11,000 mark then it has to be the BFSI sector that needs to drive it.

edited excerpt:

Q: Midcap and Smallcaps have traded in line with benchmarks for last three weeks. Does it mean that the worst is over now and the growth will reflect in numbers soon or is it just a hope rally?

Off late the breadth of the market has improved a lot. The BSE Smallcap index rose by 3.6 percent last week with more than 190 stocks rising between 10-60 percent. This month-to-date (MTD) the BSE Smallcap index is up 14 percent as compared to around 7 percent gain seen in the Nifty50. Most mid and smallcaps are doing catch-up because of their beaten down nature.

Right now, broader rally seems to be on hope that things will go back to normalcy in the next few months but there are headwinds in the form of possible increase in COVID-19 cases and a reality check coming in July to August from Q1 earnings. Market needs to decisively cross the 200 WMA placed at 10,375 on a weekly closing basis for it to continue the upward momentum.

If Nifty50 breaks past the 200-WMA then mid and smallcaps could see more action than the largecaps. Within the smallcaps it will be the beaten downs names that could outperform meaningfully.

Q: Do you think India-China border situation is really a big concern? Which sectors will get affected and benefitted the most by this factor?

The markets would take the India-China standoff negatively only when there is a war like situation. Although forces are almost on war-like alert market is still not building in the scenario of a full-fledged war as of now.

The border issue may not impact earnings and economic growth but the increase in COVID-19 cases could. The standoff with China could lead to slight increase in defence budget and expedition of pending projects in this space.

Hence, companies associated with defence manufacturing and supply could benefit. Don't see any particular sector getting impacted negatively unless there is a full-fledged war in future.

Q: Market after consolidation again gained strength to march upwards, though there is still a risk of rising coronavirus infections. Do you think the market is waiting for vaccine to rally above 11,000 or the global liquidity (or any other strong reason) can take it above 11,000 mark easily in coming weeks?

The Nifty50 has already rallied 37 percent from the recent low. In the immediate future it first needs to break above the 200 WMA placed at 10,375 level decisively on a weekly basis for the rally to extend. The force of liquidity is very strong on a global scale and it is one factor that can drive Nifty50 closer to 11,000 in near future, provided global markets lead the rally. The Nifty50 is trading at peak valuations hence there is very less value left in the largecap space except for select BFSI stocks. Based on expert advice in the healthcare sector, commercial launch of an effective vaccine seems far away. As and when we have an effective vaccine markets will respond positively at that time. As of now 11,000 seems to be the best case scenario for Nifty-50 based on earnings and valuations.

Q: Reliance Industries completed its net debt free plan well ahead of its own target of March 31, 2021, and as a result it touched a fresh record high last week. Do you think the stock will cross Rs 2,000 mark soon given the expected growth in coming quarters, and what are key triggers to watch out for?

The Bloomberg consensus estimate of Reliance post June 15 works to Rs 1,700. We have a one year price target of Rs 1,750. Hence, the one year upside as of now comes in the Rs 1,700-1,800 price range. These estimates factor in the reduction in interest cost, future cash flows and SOTP valuation of various businesses. If liquidity force takes the Nifty50 above the 200 WMA then Reliance can go to Rs 2,000.

There are many triggers to watch for in Reliance in future. The company is working on two large transactions: 1] sale of 20 percent stake in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business to Saudi Aramco and 2] monetization of fibre InvIT. With such huge cash inflow the company also has the option of exploring inorganic opportunities in future.

Q: Banking and financials has been the key factor for directional move on either side in the last one month or so. What does it indicate, as it is the backbone of the economy?

BFSI stocks have grossly underperformed the market in the recent rally due to uncertainties associated with the sector. However, BFSI stocks have made a smart come back in the last few trading sessions. Few banks have highlighted that number of customers under moratorium have gone down sharply in June. HDFC Bank said on last Wednesday that its consumer loans have gone back to pre-COVID levels. The Supreme court hearing was also not too negative for banks. If Nifty50 has to go closer to 11,000 mark then it has to be the BFSI sector that needs to drive it. The uncertainties on loan growth and future NPAs will still remain a hangover for BFSI stocks. Hence, it is ideal to accumulate BFSI stocks in every decline so as to mitigate any near term downside.

Q: What are your thoughts on the Supreme Court's comments on the AGR issue? And also what is your take on entire telecom space and do you expect more tariff hikes in coming months as there are only three players?

The matter is still sub judice as the next hearing is in the third week of July. Based on the last hearing it seems that the Supreme Court is not averse to staggered payments but needs a reasonable amount to be paid upfront. The telecom sector looks very attractive and we have a buy rating on Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 690. Bharti reported ARPU of Rs 154 per subscriber per month in Q4FY20. In the post results concall of Q4FY20 the management of Bharti said that current tariffs are still at low levels. They have guided for ARPUs to move to Rs 200 in the short term and Rs 300 in the medium term. Besides tariff hikes, ARPU will also be driven by increase in share of 4G subscribers (i.e. better mix).

Q: What are those sectors one should stick to and avoid now, why?

From a catch-up perspective banks and NBFCs have very good upside left. On Price/Book Value basis most banks and NBFCs are trading at lower end of their historic range. Other beaten down sectors related to economy which we like are: capital goods, construction, utilities, metals and oil & gas. Most of these economy related sectors will report very poor numbers in FY21 due to COVID-19 and lockdown. However, the low base and recovery in the economy will lead to very high growth in FY22 earnings.

Hence from a FY22 perspective most of these economy related sectors look attractive. Sectors we would stay away are: consumer durables (due to rich valuations), Agro Chemicals (due to steep run up and rich valuations), IT (due to subdued earnings growth and higher valuations) and pharma (due to sharp run up and rich valuations in the context of poor RoEs).

Relience_Industries,22-06-2020,Reliance Industries to hold virtual AGM on July 15,"After Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Reliance Industries will hold its first virtual annual general meeting of shareholders on July 15 as public gatherings are not possible in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

In a regulatory filing, Reliance - the country's most valuable company- said ""the 43rd AGM will be held on Wednesday, July 15, 2020 at 2 pm though video conferencing / other audio-visual means.""

TCS held virtual annual general meeting (AGM) on June 11.

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has permitted to hold AGM through video conference / other audio visual means without the physical presence of members at a common venue.

So far, all the post-IPO AGMs of Reliance have been physical meetings that have often been equated with big fat Indian weddings.

The company that is widely credited with having launched the equity culture in India, held AGMs in stadiums during times of its founder Dhirubhai Ambani.

In 1985, 12,000 of them attended the Reliance AGM at the Cooperage Football Ground in Mumbai's Colaba. The next year, around 35,000 attended it at the city's Cross Maidan.

Over the years, the AGMs got shifted to auditoriums even as its shareholder base swelled to over 24 lakh.

At the last AGM on August 12, 2019, the firm's billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a roadmap for Reliance to become a net-debt free company before March 31, 2021.

""We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by March 31, 2021,"" he had said, highlighting strong interest from strategic and financial investors in consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail.

But the oil-to-telecom conglomerate achieved net-debt free status last week itself on the back of a record Rs 1.69 lakh crore fund raising from stake sales and rights issue.

Reliance secured over Rs 1.15 lakh crore from global tech investors including Facebook by selling a little less than a quarter of its digital business and raised Rs 53,124 crore by selling shares to existing investors in the past 58 days.

Taken together with last year's sale of 49 per cent stake in fuel retailing venture to BP Plc of UK for Rs 7,000 crore, the total fund raised is in excess of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, the company had said last week.

Reliance had a net debt of Rs 1,61,035 crore as on March 31, 2020. ""With these investments, RIL has become net-debt free,"" it had said.

At the last AGM, Ambani had also announced plans to sell a USD 15 billion stake in his group's oil-to-chemical business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co but the deal has got slightly delayed.

Not to be outdone by the delay, he lured partners to Jio Platforms Ltd, which houses India's biggest telecom firm by subscribers, Reliance Jio.

With more than 388 million users, Jio has forced out several rivals and driven consolidation in the sector since entering the market in 2016 with free voice services and cut-price data.

Sale of stake in Jio Platforms raised Rs 1,15,693.95 crore from leading global investors including Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton and PIF since April 22, 2020.

Alongside, Reliance launched India's biggest right issue, which was subscribed 1.59 times."
Relience_Industries,22-06-2020,RIL market value higher than combined market-cap of top 3 private banks,"The market-cap of Reliance Industries on June 22 surpassed the combined market value of top three private sector banks.

The billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned company's stock has been gaining currency since it started announcing deals with tech companies and marquee investment firms. It crossed m-cap of Rs 11 lakh crore.

The stock touched record high of Rs 1,804.10 today, amounting to m-cap of Rs 11,43,691.76 crore, or $150 billion. It gained a whopping 108 percent from its March lows and retained the top slot among Nifty50 stocks, doubling shareholders' money in just three months.

At 12.30 pm, it was trading at Rs 1,768, up 0.48 percent with a market cap of Rs 11,20,774.83 crore, which was much higher than combined market value of Rs 10,73,613.94 crore of top three private sector banks - HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

HDFC Bank (at Rs 1,039.95, up 0.61 percent) has current market capitalisation of Rs 5,70,961.52 crore, Kotak Mahindra Bank (at Rs 1,331.80, up 2.29 percent) Rs 2,63,507.48 crore and ICICI Bank (at Rs 369.20, up 1.46 percent) Rs 2,39,144.94 crore.

RIL's market cap was also higher than the HDFC Group which is valued at Rs 10,45,433.95 crore. HDFC has market cap of Rs 3,17,367.24 crore, HDFC Life Rs 1,04,249.90 crore and HDFC AMC Rs 52,855.29 crore.

Reliance Industries has become net debt free last week after it closed the last Jio Platforms' deal which was with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

Jio Platforms has raised Rs 1,15,693.95 crore by selling 24.7 percent stake to global technology investors since April 22.

With this Rs 1.15 lakh crore, rights issue of Rs 53,124.20 crore and the stake sale to BP in the petro-retail JV, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned conglomerate has raised more than Rs 1.75 lakh crore and became net-debt free well before the deadline of March 31, 2021.

The company's net debt was Rs 1,61,035 crore as on March 31, 2020.

""The recent rally in Reliance Industries on the back of large deals in Jio Platforms by marquee names like Facebook, KKR, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners and General Atlantic and the underperformance of the BFSI segment has led to market cap of Reliance being more than the sum of marekt cap of the top-3 private banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank),"" Motilal Oswal said.

Relience_Industries,21-06-2020,"'COVID-19 vaccine, not liquidity, a big impetus for Nifty to climb 11K'","I don't think global liquidity can take Nifty above 11,000 in the coming weeks, but if the situation is constantly improving, we may reach 11,000 in a span of 2-3 months, Sumit Bilgaiyan, Founder of Equity99 said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.

edited excerpts:

Q) After consolidation, the markets again moved upwards in the week gone by despite a continual rise in coronavirus infections in the country. Do you think global liquidity can push Nifty above 11,000?

A) I think the COVID-19 vaccine will be a big impetus for the Nifty to rally above 11,000 as it will ensure smooth 'U-shaped' recovery for all the sectors and eliminated the risk of another lockdown. I don't think global liquidity can take it above 11,000 in the coming weeks, but if the situation is constantly improving, we may reach 11,000 in a span of 2-3 months.

Q) Reliance Industries completed its net debt-free plan well ahead of its target of 2021. Do you think the stock will cross Rs 2,000 mark soon given the expected growth in coming quarters?

A) I believe a lot of positivity about the company has already been factored in the stock price, I expect it to remain rangebound between Rs 1,700-2,000 in the coming months. Weakness in demand for petrochemical business and negative outlook amid weak discretionary spending for retail business will be a drag on the stock price.

Q) Midcap and smallcaps have been trading in line with the benchmarks for the last three weeks. Does it mean that the worst is over and the growth will reflect in the numbers soon?

A) No, I don't think we will be looking at growth over the next 3-4 quarters, it will take at least a year for earnings performance to stabilise. Worst case for business might be considered to be over provided, there are no more lockdown and infections are in control, which I believe is being factored in the stock prices. Many good quality small and midcaps, with limited risks, are available at super cheap valuations, which definitely makes a very good case to buy them for investors.

Q) Do you think the India-China border situation is really a big concern now. And will it have major implications on financials, and corporate earnings and economic growth?

A) I don't think India- China tussle will be a major issue, or rather, both the governments would prefer keeping the relations intact as India and China are heavily dependent on each other. If the situation worsens and relations are impacted, the key adverse effects will be felt by startup fundings, pharma sector, consumer durables, electrical components and machinery and chemicals.

Q) Banking and financials have been the key factor for directional move on either side in the last month or so. What does it indicate?

A) It clearly shows that investors are expecting a 'U-shaped' path to recovery which will keep the financial stress on various sectors limited and not elongated. As the economy has opened up, investors expect that NPA issue will not be a major one, and thus, banking and financial sector will not face severe pain on that front. It will be a key monitorable to track how the various sectors in the country are performing and whether demand comes back to pre-COVID levels.

Q) What are key triggers to watch out for in the coming week?

A) The main thing to watch out will be the COVID-19 cases and COVID scenario in the metro cities. Indo-China resolutions will also be crucial.

The BSE Sensex rallied 950.85 points or 2.81 percent last week.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) was the star performer in the top-10 list, as its market valuation zoomed Rs 1,08,213.62 crore to Rs 11,15,418.03 crore during the week.

It became the first Indian company to cross the Rs 11 lakh crore market valuation mark on June 19 after Mukesh Ambani announced that his oil-to-telecom conglomerate had become net debt-free.

Relience_Industries,21-06-2020,"'COVID-19 vaccine, not liquidity, a big impetus for Nifty to climb 11K'","I don't think global liquidity can take Nifty above 11,000 in the coming weeks, but if the situation is constantly improving, we may reach 11,000 in a span of 2-3 months, Sumit Bilgaiyan, Founder of Equity99 said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.

edited excerpts:

Q) After consolidation, the markets again moved upwards in the week gone by despite a continual rise in coronavirus infections in the country. Do you think global liquidity can push Nifty above 11,000?

A) I think the COVID-19 vaccine will be a big impetus for the Nifty to rally above 11,000 as it will ensure smooth 'U-shaped' recovery for all the sectors and eliminated the risk of another lockdown. I don't think global liquidity can take it above 11,000 in the coming weeks, but if the situation is constantly improving, we may reach 11,000 in a span of 2-3 months.

Q) Reliance Industries completed its net debt-free plan well ahead of its target of 2021. Do you think the stock will cross Rs 2,000 mark soon given the expected growth in coming quarters?

A) I believe a lot of positivity about the company has already been factored in the stock price, I expect it to remain rangebound between Rs 1,700-2,000 in the coming months. Weakness in demand for petrochemical business and negative outlook amid weak discretionary spending for retail business will be a drag on the stock price.

Q) Midcap and smallcaps have been trading in line with the benchmarks for the last three weeks. Does it mean that the worst is over and the growth will reflect in the numbers soon?

A) No, I don't think we will be looking at growth over the next 3-4 quarters, it will take at least a year for earnings performance to stabilise. Worst case for business might be considered to be over provided, there are no more lockdown and infections are in control, which I believe is being factored in the stock prices. Many good quality small and midcaps, with limited risks, are available at super cheap valuations, which definitely makes a very good case to buy them for investors.

Q) Do you think the India-China border situation is really a big concern now. And will it have major implications on financials, and corporate earnings and economic growth?

A) I don't think India- China tussle will be a major issue, or rather, both the governments would prefer keeping the relations intact as India and China are heavily dependent on each other. If the situation worsens and relations are impacted, the key adverse effects will be felt by startup fundings, pharma sector, consumer durables, electrical components and machinery and chemicals.

Relience_Industries,19-06-2020,"HDFC looking to raise up to Rs 14,000 crore to bolster liquidity and expand business","India’s largest private sector mortgage financier Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC Ltd) is all set to join fellow heavyweights like RIL, Bharti Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank and raise capital to strengthen its balance sheet. A committee of directors of the firm today approved a massive fund raising exercise of up to Rs 14,000 crore in one or more tranches through a combination of financial instruments.

Earlier this week, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported about the mega fundraising plans of the Deepak Parekh-led housing finance powerhouse. The report had said HDFC Ltd was looking to raise around Rs 12,000 crore in multiple tranches via a combination of a QIP and an NCD (non-convertible debenture ) + warrant or FCCB ( foreign currency convertible bond route) .

It had added that the firm wanted to boost its capital buffers due to the uncertainty caused post the outbreak of COVID-19 and potential concerns on asset quality.

The fundraising could be carried out in one or more tranches via issuance of equity shares or compulsorily convertible debentures, non-convertible debentures along with warrants, foreign currency convertible bonds either through a qualified institutional placement or other permissible modes, the company said in its official statement today.

The HDFC statement added that the said funds are being raised to augment its long term resources , finance organic & inorganic business opportunities that may arise in financial services including housing finance and /or in areas where its subsidiaries operate, and to maintain sufficient liquidity and for general corporate purposes.

The company reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,232.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, declining 22 percent due to higher provisions related to COVID-19 and high base last year. Provisions (expected credit loss) increased significantly to Rs 1,274 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 which included the impact of COVID-19, against Rs 398 crore in March quarter 2019.

HDFC said it has made provisions of Rs 10,988 crore as of March 31. This is Rs 6,800 crore over and above the regulatory requirement. To be sure, HDFC Ltd has a capital adequacy of 17.7 percent (of which 16.6 percent is tier one capital), which is one of the highest in the financial sector in India.

The gross non-performing loans as of March 31, 2020, stood at Rs 8,908 crore. This is equivalent to 1.99 per cent of the loan portfolio. The non-performing loans of the individual portfolio stood at 0.95 per cent while that of the non-individual portfolio stood at 4.71 percent."
Relience_Industries,19-06-2020,RIL doubled investor wealth since March 23; market-cap crosses Rs 11 lakh crore,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries became a major wealth creator among Nifty stocks during the lockdown period as it doubled investors' wealth since March 23.

The oil-telecom-to-retail major also become the first listed company to cross Rs 11-lakh-crore in market capitalisation.

And the all credit goes to its telecom business Jio Platforms which helped Reliance raise more than Rs 1.15 lakh crore in just 58 days.

The stock touched a record high of Rs 1,788.60 today, rising 8 percent intraday and 106.2 percent from its March 23's low of Rs 867.43, especially after Mukesh Ambani in a statement said he has fulfilled his promise to the shareholders by making Reliance net debt-free much before target of March 31, 2021.

Reliance Chairman and Managing Director, in company's AGM last year, had assured the shareholders that Reliance will become a net-debt free company before March 31, 2021.

""We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by March 31, 2021,"" he had said.

The stock closed at Rs 1,759.50, up Rs 103.25 or 6.23 percent on the BSE, with a market capitalisation of Rs 11,15,418.03 crore.

Reliance Industries has raised over Rs 1,68,818 crore in just 58 days through investments in Jio Platforms by global tech investors (Rs 1,15,693.95 crore) and rights issue of Rs 53,124.20 crore.

""The combined capital raised has no precedence globally in such a short time. Both of these are also unprecedented in Indian corporate history and have set new benchmarks. This is even more remarkable that this was achieved amidst a global lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said the company in its BSE filing.

Along with the stake sale to BP in the petro-retail JV, the total fund raise is in excess of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, it added.

""Our net-debt was Rs 1,61,035 crore, as on March 31, 2020. With these investments, RIL has become net debt-free,"" Reliance said.

Jio Platforms has raised Rs 1,15,693.95 crore from leading global investors including Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton and PIF since April 22, 2020, against stake of 24.70 percent.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund's investment marks the end of Jio Platforms' current phase of induction of financial partners.

""We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in our consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail. We will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years,"" Mukesh Ambani said.

""With these initiatives, I have no doubt that your company will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Reliance Industries partly paid up rights shares were locked in 10 percent upper circuit at Rs 812.90 following the end of debt reduction plan, with trading volumes of over 49 lakh shares.

Relience_Industries,19-06-2020,COVID-19 impact: SEBI paves way for consolidation of promoter stake and quicker QIP deals in listed companies,"While the big boys of India Inc like RIL, Bharti Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank are cruising through the lockdown period with ease, small-cap and mid-cap entities are facing severe cash flow and valuation issues.

Here is what PVR Ltd, the nation’s largest operator of multi-screen theatres, has to say.

“Since all cinemas are shut, the company is not generating any revenue from operations while we continue to incur committed cash outflows, including salary payouts, overheads as well as payments for older working capital,” it said in a communication to the stock exchanges on June 8.

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail is another example. The company has seen a dramatic drop in footfalls at stores and plunging sales from the second week of March.

“Eventually, it had to shut down its entire retail network through the month in line with the nationwide lockdown. This had an adverse impact on the quarterly performance,” the company said on May 27.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Ajay Tyagi and team is aware of the woes of the smaller players and has taken several steps to help the companies.

Sebi has relaxed the fund-raising norms by amending the Takeover Code and the ICDR ( Issue of Capital & Disclosure ) Regulations. The new rules were notified on June 16.

In the last few months, Sebi had already taken a few other steps like extending the approval validity for launching IPOs by six months, relaxing the norms for changing the size of fresh issues, widening the eligibility for companies to fast-track rights issues, slashing broker turnover fees and filing charges for issuers, and directing listed companies to disclose the impact of COVID-19 on their operations.

Subsequently, the Ajay Bijli-promoted PVR approved a Rs 300 crore-rights issue while bracing for a “significant negative impact on profitability and liquidity during lockdown and even thereafter till business comes to normalcy.” Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail is also planning a rights issue.

WILL THE TWEAKS TO THE TAKEOVER CODE ENTHUSE PROMOTERS?

The changes to the takeover code will now allow promoters to acquire up to 10 per cent in their firms (as compared to 5 per cent earlier, referred to as a creeping acquisition) in a financial year without an open offer.

Promoters, however, can do that only through a preferential issue of shares and after pumping in fresh capital. A preferential issue is a sale of shares by a firm to a select group of investors, and is considered one of the swiftest ways to raise capital.

The move is valid till March 31, 2021.

Sandip Bhagat, partner at law firm S&R Associates, says it’s a welcome move as it would offer promoters more flexibility and help listed companies to raise fresh funds from promoters in these tough times. This step is also a breather to companies which were finding it difficult to access debt financing and equity financing.

But the jury is out on whether the limited relaxation of an additional 5 per cent would be sufficient for companies.

“The doubling of head room for creeping acquisition, solely for promoters and solely for the infusion of fresh money into the company seems like a nudge to enable money being invested into business instead of being spent on buying shares,” says securities law expert and advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan.

In the current environment, businesses are looking at shareholders to tap fund-raising avenues and create adequate liquidity buffers.

“Promoters with deep pockets could bring in funds and ensure cash flow in trying times like now. It’s the first attempt at a fixed-term provision with a sunset clause just for this financial year. It would be interesting to see if it is put to use,” Sundaresan adds.

Many corporates have warmed up to rights issues (issue of shares at a special price for existing shareholders) in recent months, which have seen promoters lapping up residual or renounced shares.

Even private equity firms are focusing more on the operations of their portfolio firms.

“While rights issue was one avenue, one limitation for listed companies was the inability to raise capital from promoters in excess of 5 per cent in a financial year without a mandatory open offer for another 26 per cent. SEBI has been intelligent enough to help companies by making this relaxation,” says Aakash Choubey, Partner, Khaitan & Co.

THE PRICING FACTOR

Pricing is always an important criterion for such equity issues, but this time Sebi has left the pricing norms for preferential allotment unchanged. Choubey wonders if the move would be enough to help companies deal with liquidity issues. Since there is no relaxation on floor pricing, companies may find it an expensive option.

Unlike rights issue, preferential issues are carried out via a SEBI- approved formula at an average price of the last two weeks or past 26 weeks, whichever is higher. In the COVID-19 era, there is a substantial gap between the current market price and the price arrived at by using the Sebi formula, making it really tough for firms.

As part of the June 16 amendment, Sebi has also relaxed the provision for voluntary open offers by temporarily removing a disqualification condition.

Earlier, a shareholder with 25 per cent or more shares or voting rights was permitted to make a voluntary open offer, but only if he had not acquired any shares of the company via the creeping acquisition route in the preceding 52 weeks.

That condition has now been relaxed till March 31, 2021, giving a fresh option to promoters to consolidate their holdings, but less than the overall public shareholding threshold of 75 per cent.

REDUCING THE QIP COOLING-OFF PERIOD

As part of the changes notified on June 16, the market regulator also substantially reduced the mandatory gap between back-to-back qualified institutional placements or QIPs by a listed firm to two weeks. Earlier, firms were required to maintain a gap of six months between two QIPs.

Will this help?

“Possibly -- for those firms that need money in quick succession,” feels Bhagat. Capital market experts believe the move will help corporates time their fund-raising plans better and give them greater flexibility to launch share sales based on share price movement.

But then there are those who wonder if issuers can execute deals so quickly today and if risk-averse investors would be comfortable with such short gaps.

Fund-raising conditions are not ideal for firms outside the heavyweight category. “In the current unprecedented situation, investors will prefer to seek safety in established businesses. All over the world, big is becoming bigger. In such a scenario, investors will prefer to be with leaders, which, by definition, are large-cap companies,” says Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC.

Interestingly, since 2009, even with a gap of nine months between subsequent QIPs, only four placements emerge, according to Prime Database. The list includes Unitech Ltd and 3i Infotech in 2009, Mannapuram General Finance & Leasing in 2010 and Dhanalaxmi Bank in 2013. Unitech had the shortest gap of 71 days.

(Source: PRIME Database)

Between March 25, 2020 (the beginning of the nationwide lockdown) and June 3, 2020, Indian companies raised Rs 7,443 crore via the QIP route, which represents a 135 per cent increase, compared to the same period last year.

FY 2019-20 was an active period for the QIP route, with corporates raising Rs 51,216 crore from 13 QIPs. In FY 18-19, Rs 10,489 crore was raised from the same number of QIPs. Both QIPs and preferential issues require shareholder approval via a special resolution.

The path has been set for a smooth sail for the small-cap and mid-cap companies. But are these measures enough and are more required? The markets will provide the clue in the coming days."
Relience_Industries,19-06-2020,How Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Limited became net debt-free,"Reliance Industries Limited said on June 19 it had become net debt-free eight months ahead of March 2021 deadline it had set for itself.

The target of making the oil-to-telecom behemoth debt-free was outlined by Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani at RIL’s 42nd Annual General Meeting on August 12, 2019.

""We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net-debt company within the next 18 months, that is by 31st March 2021,” Ambani said. “We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in our consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail.

Along with the stake sale to BP in the petro-retail JV, the total fund-raise is in excess of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, way higher than the company's debt as of March 2020.

Ambani's statement at the 42nd AGM had indicated investor interest in Jio.

Apart from this, Jio's rapid success in the telecom space drew the interest of investors globally. Three years after its launch, Jio Infocomm has emerged as the country's biggest telecom player, with a subscriber base of 38.75 crore.

The company also plans public listing of Reliance Retail and Jio over the next five years, a much-anticipated event for the market.

Relience_Industries,19-06-2020,"Reliance Retail, Jio may be listed soon; stock may touch Rs 1,900 by March","Reliance Industries (RIL) on June 19 said it is moving towards the listing of Jio and Reliance Retail within the next 5 years, the company said in a press release.

The company said it has become completely net debt-free and has raised over Rs 1.68 lakh crore in just 58 days, hinting that it will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world.

Stock market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18 that the stock of Reliance Industries may see a big re-rating. He has a target of Rs 1,900 on the stock, which Tulsian believes, it can achieve by March 2021.

Tulsian sees retail as the next growth driver for Reliance.

""The company's first goal of being debt-free has been achieved and now he does not see any further dilution in Jio Platform. The next growth area will be Reliance Retail,"" he said.

""If you compare Reliance Retail with DMart, having a market capitalisation of 1.5 lakh crore with the topline of 25,000 crore, Reliance Retail has a topline of about 2 lakh crore. So, it is about 7 times the size of the topline. I guess the valuation of Reliance Retail can be between 4-5 lakh crore,"" Tulsian said.

""Probably the process of the induction of strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail will happen like in Jio Platform,"" said Tulsian.

Tulsian said Jio may not see Indian listing as it will not be able to capture full value of the stock.

Jio may see an overseas listing in the next couple of years to give maximum value to the Reliance shareholders. Because if Jio is listed on Indian bourses, then the discounting of the holding company will start and Reliance Industries may not capture the true value. But if the Jio Platform is listed overseas then the holding company can capture the full value.

The oil-to-telecom behemoth, Reliance Industries on June 19 said it has raised over Rs 1,68,818 crore in just 58 days through the investments by global tech investors (Rs 1,15,693.95 crore) and rights issue (Rs 53,124.20 crore).

PIF’s investment marks the end of Jio Platforms’ current phase of induction of financial partners, the company said.

The RIL Rights Issue, which was subscribed 1.59 times, was not only the largest ever in India but also the largest in the world by a non-financial entity in the last ten years.

“Today I am both delighted and humbled to announce that we have fulfilled our promise to the shareholders by making Reliance net debt-free much before our original schedule of March 31, 2021,"" said the group's Chairman Mukesh Ambani.

The second instalment of Rs 314.25 will be due in May 2021 and the final instalment of Rs 628.50 in November 2021.

This is the biggest ever rights issue by an Indian company, and the first by Reliance Industries in 30 years.

Relience_Industries,25-05-2020,Crude processing in April sees biggest drop in nearly two decades,"India's crude oil processing in April slumped by 28.8 percent from a year earlier, its biggest drop since at least 2003, as a nationwide lockdown weighed on fuel demand and forced refiners to cut production.

Refiners processed about 14.75 million tonnes or 3.60 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil last month, government data showed.

The lockdown and travel curbs aimed at stemming spread of COVID-19 since March 25 forced people to stay home, cutting India's fuel demand by 45.8 percent in April.

Falling demand led Indian refiners and gas importers to declare force majeure on imports.

Refiners, struggling to store oil and products, had to sell some oil to the federal government which used it to fill strategic storage.

India has extended its nationwide restrictions to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases leading to some recovery in fuel demand and refiner runs this month.

Indian refiners operated at about 72 percent of their overall capacity of about 5 million bpd, the data showed.

Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, operated its plant at about 53 percent capacity, while use at the refineries owned by its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum plunged to about 33 percent of capacity, the data showed.

Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, operated its export-focussed 700,000 bpd Jamnagar refinery at about 87 percent capacity.

Nayara Energy, part owned by Russia's Rosneft, curtailed runs at its 400,000 bpd Vadinar refinery to 85 percent of capacity.

India, which imports over 80 percent of its oil needs, produced 6.4 percent less oil in April than a year earlier at around 2.55 million tonnes or 620,000 bpd, data showed.

Natural gas output fell 18.6 percent to 2.16 billion cubic metres, data showed.

Relience_Industries,25-05-2020,RIL Rights Entitlement: An opportunity for retail shareholders and arbitragers,"Narendra Solanki

Reliance industries has announced the rights issue and currently the issue is open for subscription which would last till June 3, 2020. This Rights Issue looks and is also similar to most rights issues opened in the past for various companies except one thing which has set this issue apart from others in past.

Yes, from this current Reliance Rights Issue we have been experiencing a historical first trading of Rights Entitlements through exchange mechanism which was also happening earlier but only in offline market and with physical form mostly.

This new introduction has opened opportunity for many retail investors to either participate in the rights issue like normally and also sell their eligible/entitled portion of shares to other willing investors who may have missed the opportunity due to lapse of record date or want to bid for higher number of shares than originally entitled ration of one rights share for every fifteen equity shares of Reliance Industries.

Not only this, the current mechanism has also opened up various opportunities for arbitrage seeking players who could benefit from the momentary mispricing between rights issue and fully paid up equity shares. Hence providing both depth and liquidity in the markets during the process.

Now without taking much time, let's look what are the details of this offer and what kind of opportunities are or could arise out of the present situation.

Firstly, let us see the details of the offer briefly below;

So, above is the snapshot of the rights issue offer presently on offer by Reliance Industries which the shareholders can apply through provided mechanism detailed by the company.

Now coming to the new exchange traded entitlement mechanism which has been effected from this and hopefully continue to forthcoming issues as well. Let us understand how this works.

Exchange Traded Entitlement Mechanism:

The exchange traded entitlement (Rights Entitlement) which has been effective as mentioned in below table is basically a mechanism where the participants who want to subscribe for more than the allotted shares in the rights issue can buy such rights entitlements from the exchange window and become eligible for the application and similarly vice versa.

Now, with this the new mechanism an opportunity arises for both the normal shareholders as well as the arbitragers who could gain whenever mispricing is available in the markets. But before detailing that, let us first simply understand what is the actual value of rights issue since, it is not paid in full on June 3, 2020 but in three instalments over eighteen months timeline.

In the above table we have calculated a simple present value of the payments any person is going to make to subscribe to the rights issue. As already known that payments are scheduled in three parts over next eighteen months hence an investor is just paying only 25 percent of the amount initially and remaining amount is paid over eighteen months. Hence, this remaining amount is available to an investor in cash to earn either interest if deposited in banks or earn capital gains if invested in markets.

Thus, we have assumed two scenarios wherein we assume that an investor could earn 10 percent or 6 percent of the remaining 75 percent of amount till he is called in to pay these instalments by the company. So in this case we have discounted back the instalments with these assumed rates and calculated that the estimated present value of the rights issue which is available at Rs 1,257 per rights share at 10 percent discount rate is Rs 1,141 and at 6 percent discount rate is Rs 1,184.

Now in below table we see how to calculate the value of rights renunciation (Rights Entitlement), in this case RIL-RE which is currently trading in exchanges.

There are two aspects namely fixed and variable while pricing rights renunciation as mentioned in above table. The fixed aspect is arrived by deducting present value calculated from rights price of Rs 1,257 which in this case is Rs 115.8 at 10 percent discount rate and Rs 72.64 at 6 percent discount rate, since the rights price is fixed hence it is called fixed component.

To arrive at the variable component we have to take into account the difference between current prices of the Reliance Industries fully paid equity shares and rights price and then add it to the previous fixed component. In this case it is Rs 184.25 and because the CMP of Reliance changes daily hence this difference is dynamic and called as variable component.

Thus, the value of rights renunciation (RE) should theoretically be about Rs 300 at 10 percent and Rs 257 at 6 percent discount rates, respectively.

Execution aspects of the trade:

As we have arrived at the present value and estimated the value at which Reliance RE units should trade and also similarly after the allotment of rights share the rights share should also trade with similar values while adding the paid amount to the already calculated RIL-RE values.

However, as an investor or a trader let's look at various execution strategies one could do to benefit out of this mechanism.

1.> Buying Rights Entitlement units: Any investor who wants to have an exposure in Reliance equity shares can instead subscribe for rights issue by simply buying the Reliance Industries - Rights entitlement units (RIL-RE) from exchanges at prices lower than his/her discounted rates as shown in above examples and could earn some additional returns over and above the return given by the underlying Reliance shares. Table below shows relationship between discount rate, RIL-RE price and expected return an investor could generate.

2.> Selling Existing shares and buying same through RIL-RE mechanism: Any investor who already has invested in the fully paid Reliance shares have an opportunity to lower their cost of acquisition by executing below mentioned trades. As seen in the table below an existing share can lower his acquisition cost by this strategy. And also enjoys an additional liquidity of Rs 893.4 per share for the next one year as second instalment is due not before May-2021 and can generate additional returns from this amount by investing in any asset class of his/her choice.

The overall risk profile to the trade is similar as was before which is exposure to Reliance Industries equity and its price movements.

Relience_Industries,22-05-2020,Reliance selling 17% stake in Jio Platforms in 1 month to help pare half its net debt: Moody's,"Reliance Industries selling over 17 percent stake in its digital unit Jio Platforms for a combined Rs 78,562 crore in one month will help pare about half of its net debt of Rs 1.61 lakh crore, Moody's Investors Service said on Friday.

The credit rating agency comment on a day when Reliance announced sale of 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms to global investment firm KKR & Co. Inc for Rs 11,367 crore -- the fifth deal in four weeks that will inject a combined Rs 78,562 crore in the oil-to-telecom conglomerate to help it pare debt.

""Proceeds from these divestments alone will help the company pare around 49 percent of its net debt of Rs 1.61 lakh crore outstanding as of March 31, 2020,"" Moody's said in an issuer note.

Exactly a month back, Facebook picked up 9.99 percent stake in the firm that houses India's youngest but largest telecom company for Rs 43,574 crore.

Within days of that deal, Silver Lake -- the world's largest tech investor -- bought 1.15 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 5,665.75 crore.

On May 8, US-based Vista Equity Partners bought 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 11,367 crore and on May 17 global equity firm General Atlantic picked up 1.34 percent stake for Rs 6,598.38 crore.

""These divestments are credit positive because proceeds from sales of the stakes will be used for debt reduction and bring the company closer to its target of reducing its net debt to zero by March 2021,"" Moody's said.

All the transactions are currently underway and subject to regulatory and other approvals.

""Successful completion of the transactions will help to alleviate the negative impact of lower earnings caused by disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak,"" it added.

The rating agency expects a 16-17 percent drop in Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, compared to fiscal 2020.

While EBITDA for the company's digital services segment will continue to grow during the coronavirus outbreak, it expects EBITDA for the refining and petrochemical segments to be weaker as a standstill in global travel and slowdown in economic activity will weaken the demand for transportation fuel and petrochemicals.

""As a result, we expect RIL's leverage, as measured by adjusted net debt/EBITDA, to remain appropriately positioned for its current rating,"" it said.

Other steps taken by the company to reduce its net debt to zero include the partial divestment of its oil-to-chemical business (USD 15 billion) and fuel retailing business (USD 1 billion) to Saudi Aramco and BP Plc, respectively.

In addition, Reliance hanced a rights issue offering to raise around Rs 53,215 crore and use the proceeds toward debt reduction, it added."
Relience_Industries,22-05-2020,Explainer | What is a Rights Entitlement? And How to participate in it?,"The Rs 53,125 crore Rights Issue of Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries opened for subscription on May 20 and will close on June 3.

It means investors who held equity shares of Reliance Industries as on May 14, the record date, are eligible or entitled for rights shares. These same investors can either retain this entitlement to get partly paid rights shares in June by paying first installment of Rs 314.25 per share (of total rights issue price of Rs 1,257) or can transfer these shares in part or full to others through trading platform introduced by SEBI.

So What is Right Entitlement?

The Rights Entitlement platform allows the rights holders to trade their entitlement shares on a trading window on exchanges where holders can sell and renounce their entitlement for a price.

""This is a real test to the Rights Entitlement trading platform as the response from the same would be monitored and examined by SEBI. Intraday trading is not allowed in this particular platform. Only shareholders who are interested in the Rights issue are advised to participate here and existing shareholders who receive entitlement in the Rights issue are allowed to sell,"" Manali Bhatia, Senior Research Analyst at Rudra Shares and Stock Brokers said.

This process and platform gives shareholders an opportunity to gain some value of eligible RE shares. Until now, shareholders, who didn't wish to apply, had to let their RE lapse or had to transfer it for free. By introducing this platform shareholders can see value of right shares intrinsic value.

The REs are allowed to trade online and on stock exchanges, similar to equity shares. The trading of such RE will close at least three working days before the rights issue to ensure that shareholders and the renouncee have sufficient time to submit the renunciation form and the application form, respectively.

Reliance Industries RE closed at Rs 233.6 on the National Stock Exchange May 21, up 15.6 percent.

In the case of Reliance, trading for RE shares will close on May 29, so that as per T+2 schedule eligible shareholders should be finalised by June 2 and the first installment payment should be done by June 3.

""SEBI introduced this platform to reduce the timelines of such right issues and simplifies the process of Rights Issue and also provide clarity on the renunciation and trading of rights entitlements. These steps are welcomed and will potentially make rights issues a preferred option to raise capital for listed companies and also benefiting shareholders,"" said Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities told Moneycontrol.

What is Rights Issue?

A right issue is a security that is issued by a company to its existing shareholders on a pre-determined date called the record date or Rights issue refers to buying of shares by the existing shareholders at a discounted price on a particular ratio.

In case of Reliance Industries, after finalising the eligibility, partly paid up Rights shares will be allotted and credited to eligible shareholders by June 11 and same shares will be listed on bourses on June 12. Partly paid up is because investor will be paying only first installment while the second (Rs 314.25) and third/final installment (Rs 628.50) will be paid by investor in May 2021 and November 2021 respectively.

Two Types of Rights Issues:

Renounceable Rights Issue: Here, an existing shareholder of the company has the right to transfer his/her right to subscribe rights issue of shares to anyone who may not be even shareholder of the company.

Non-Renounceable Rights Issue: The existing shareholders do not have the right to transfer his/her right to subscribe rights issue of shares to anyone. Here, the shareholder only has two options available, either to skip or purchase the shares.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Rights Issue

Advantages:

>> It is the fastest method & cheapest source of raising capital for a company.

>> Rights issue helps promoters to increase their shareholding. The shareholders can subscribe to an 'unsubscribed portion' of the issue, which elevates their shareholding.

>> Company also saves a significant amount of money, such as underwriting fees, advertisement cost and so on, i.e. company does not have to incur additional expenses for raising fresh equity.

>> The major advantage of the right issue is - the existing shareholder of the company has right to receive shares on a particular ratio set by the company. In case of Reliance Industries, the entitlement ratio is 1:15, one rights equity share for every 15 equity shares held by existing shareholders) at a discount to the current market price.

Disadvantages:

> Value of each share may get diluted.

> Raising funds through the right issue might create pressure on the company.

> Stock exchanges put a restriction on the amount on which a company can raise via the right issue.

> If the share price decreases post rights issue then investor's may loose the holding value.

Relience_Industries,17-05-2020,Market Week Ahead: 10 key factors that will keep traders busy,"Details of the COVID-19 economic relief package being announced by the Centre, failed to cheer markets as benchmark indices fell for the second consecutive week that ended on May 15.

The fear of indebtedness, even after the package's announcement, no quick fix for the economy seen in measures, rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country which has delayed full reopening of the economy and concerns over United States-China relations, pulled the BSE Sensex lower by 1.7 percent and Nifty50 1.2 percent during the week.

Hence, the volatility in the market is likely to continue and the mood could largely be in favour of the bears due to the continued rise in new confirmed cases of COVID-19, uncertainty around the economy's reopening and the US-China trade tensions, experts feel.

""Government has made it clear that it will introduce the measures in tranches, but execution is key and that will be followed by the markets. Markets will also be driven by the rate of infections, lockdown 4.0 norms and any stock specific earnings commentary in the ongoing results season,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

""Additionally, emerging US-Sino relationship along with other global responses will be key clues for markets going ahead,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO at SAMCO Securities & StockNote who advised investors to remain on cash and selectively book profits which would aid to boost liquidity.

Here are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy this week:

Rising COVID-19 cases

We are in the third month of the fight against the novel coronavirus and the number for infections have been rising. However, the recovery rate is now around 35 percent against what was below 30 percent a week ago. Additionally, some areas in the country have not registered new cases for a while.

India's COVID-19 tally has crossed that of China's. India has so far reported almost 86,000 cases and around 2,750 deaths. Globally, there have been over 46.3 lakh confirmed cases of COVID-19. At least 3.11 lakh people have died so far.

Hence, the coronavirus will remain the key talking point globally unless and until a vaccine reaches at final stage.

The Centre had also sought suggestions from state governments. Reports suggest that there could be further easing of rules for reopening industries and shops in green and orange zone areas. However, these activities will be allowed only under strict social distancing norms.

Hence, the new guidelines will be the key thing to watch out for.

Reliance Industries' rights issue

Apart from the novel coronavirus pandemic, RIL's rights issue will be keenly watched by the street this week.

Reliance Industries will open its rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore on May 20 — the biggest ever by an Indian entity and the first by RIL in nearly three decades. The closing date for issue will be June 3.

The company has fixed rights issue price at Rs 1,257 per share and the rights entitlement ratio is one equity share for every 15 equity shares held by eligible shareholders as on the record date which was May 14.

""Given the pessimism on the street, it would be worthwhile to catch sight of how Reliance's rights offer sails through, measuring the retail investors response would also send a signal of strength or weakness in the market. It could be an apt yardstick to see how investors at the grassroot level are perceiving current state of the markets,"" Jimeet Modi said.

Vedanta Delising Proposal

Vedanta is an another stock to watch out for next week as billionaire Anil Agarwal has planned to make Vedanta private by buying shares from the public.

The meeting of the board of directors will take place on May 18 to consider the proposal for voluntary delisting of the company's equity shares, while SBI Capital Markets is appointed as a merchant banker to carry out due diligence.

Promoter Vedanta Resources made an offer to buy out the 48.94 percent non-promoter stake at Rs 87.5 per share, which was 9.9 percent higher over May 11 price. But currently, the stock is trading 6.2 percent higher than the offer price. Hence, another key thing to watch out for would be whether shareholders agree to the pricing.

Earnings

March quarter earnings season will continue to be longer than usual due to the coronavirus lockdown. Hence, the number of companies to announce results every week will remain less than usual.

Around 80 companies will declare their earnings this week. The key earnings to watch out for next would be Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Auto, UPL, UltraTech Cement, Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart), Jubilant FoodWorks, Tata Power, JSW Energy, Colgate Palmolive, Bajaj Finserv and Alembic Pharma.

Among others, Torrent Power, Dr Lal Path Labs, GlaxoSmithKline Pharma, Delta Corp, AstraZeneca Pharma, Apollo Tyres, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, L&T Infotech, Strides Pharma, Kalpataru Power Transmission, JK Lakshmi Cement, Tata Metaliks, Hindustan Zinc, BSE, IDFC First Bank, Bosch, Chambal Fertilizers, DCB Bank will also announce quarterly earnings.

US-China trade tensions

Last week, tensions between US and China seemed to be easing as officials of both sides had indicated of positive meetings. However, reports now suggest that the possibility of US President Donald Trump cutting relations with world's second largest economy may have increased a bit.

Reuters said the Trump administration on May 15 moved to block global chip supplies to blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, spurring fears of Chinese retaliation.

""The United States needed to stop the ""unreasonable suppression"" of Chinese companies like Huawei,"" the report said quoting China's foreign ministry.

Oil prices

Oil prices managed to hold $30 mark in the passing week also with Brent crude futures rising 5 percent to $32.50 a barrel amid gradual opening of economies, lower inventories and reduced production capacities in the US, and ahead of further capacity cut from Saudi Arabia.

But experts feel that the prices may not see big rise as the demand is yet to be picked up and economies will have to be at normal levels. Hence, there could be further consolidation in the prices.

Technical view and F&O cues

The Nifty50 fell 1.24 percent for the week and formed bearish candle on the weekly scale again, indicating bears still have upper hand at Dalal Street trade.

Experts feel the 9,050, the low point of trade on May 15, is expected to act as a support level, hence breaking of the same could take the index down to 8,900-8,500 levels while on the upside, 9,300 could be near term resistance.

""If Nifty breaks below 9,050 levels decisively, then we can expect further downside towards 8,500. MACD oscillator has provided fresh sell crossover on the daily chart. The momentum indicator RSI has also slipped below 50 levels and shows that Nifty is losing its strength and we may see further selling pressure going forward,"" Nilesh Ramesh Jain, Technical and Derivative Analyst at Anand Rathi told Moneycontrol.

The Options data indicates that the 9,000 strike which have the maximum open interest are providing support. The Call writers were active in the majority of the out-of-the-money strikes where the maximum open interest is placed at 9,500 strike, which could be resistance point.

""For the coming week, Call options have seen more writing, which means the index may remain subdued for a while declines may be seen towards 8,900,"" Amit Gupta of ICICI Securities said.

Corporate action and macro data

Here are key corporate actions taking place this week:

On the macro front, deposit and bank loan growth for the fortnight ended May 8, and foreign exchange reserves for week ended May 15 will be released on coming May 22.

Global cues

The trend in coronavirus cases, especially in the United States and European nations, and update on gradual opening of some less affected areas (due to virus) will be closely watched and could drive the sentiment.

Here are key global data points to watch out for this week:

Relience_Industries,16-05-2020,"Reliance Industries Rs 53,125 crore rights issue to open on May 20","Reliance Industries, the country's largest listed entity by market capitalisation, has fixed the opening date for its rights issue in its board meeting on May 15.

The largest ever rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore will open for subscription on May 20 and the closing date is June 3, 2020.

Its Rights Issue Committee of the board of directors also approved Abridged Letter of Offer, Application Form of Rights Issue, and Rights Entitlement Letter, to be sent to the eligible equity shareholders of the company, Reliance said in its BSE filing.

The Letter of Offer will be filed with BSE, National Stock Exchange of India and Securities and Exchange Board of India, it added.

This is the first rights issue by Reliance Industries in nearly three decades.

The oil-telecom-to-retail major had approved its rights issue on April 30 and had fixed rights issue price at Rs 1,257 per share.

The terms of payment will be 25 percent on application and balance in one or more calls as may be decided by the board of directors from time to time.

At the time of application, shareholders will pay Rs 314.25 per rights equity share (face value Rs 2.50 + premium Rs 311.75), and the balance amount of Rs 942.75 will be payable in one or more subsequent calls as determined by the board of directors, from time to time

The rights entitlement ratio is 1 equity share for every 15 equity shares held by eligible shareholders as on the record date which was May 14

""The promoter and promoter group of the company will subscribe to the full extent of their aggregate rights entitlement. In addition, they will also subscribe to all the unsubscribed shares in the issue,"" Reliance said.

Ahead of its mega rights issue, Reliance in a corporate presentation 'New Reliance for a New India' said RIL is the best proxy for India's consumption-driven and tech-propelled growth story.

It is now at the beginning of a new and unprecedented wave of wealth creation for India by harnessing the power of new technologies to fire its diverse growth engines, it said.

After entering into telecom business along with retail segment, Reliance Industries has been positioned itself as a technology and consumer company with keeping Jio at the forefront and attracted lot of foreign investors. Recently the company garnered Rs 60,596.37 crore by selling 13.47 percent stake in Jio Platforms to Facebook Inc, Silver Lake and Vista.

Jio Platforms, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, is a next-generation technology company building a Digital Society for India by bringing together Jio's leading digital apps, digital ecosystems and India's #1 high speed connectivity platform under one umbrella.

In a presentation, Reliance has highlighted hyper-growth of consumer businesses along with a robust oil-to-chemicals (O2C) platform, robust and high quality balance sheet to be sustained by strong cash flow generation, and improved cash flow generation increases potential for greater shareholder benefits, reflecting in the re-rating of the stock.

The stock shot up 66.6 percent after hitting March lows.

Relience_Industries,15-05-2020,Mutual funds picked these stocks in April; SIP inflows moderated,"The month of April saw a notable change in the sector and stock allocation of funds.

The weightage of healthcare, oil, autos, chemicals, metals and telecom increased month-on-month basis, a report titled 'Fund Folio' by Motilal Oswal Financial Services stated.

Weight of consumer, PSU Banks, Capital Goods, Technology, Retail, Private Banks, Utilities, NBFCs and Media moderated. Oil and Gas’ weight increased for the second consecutive month to climb a new high of 9.1 percent.

Consumer stocks' weight moderated after rising for 3 consecutive months to 8.8 percent.

As a result, the sector slipped to the third position in the allocation of mutual funds, making way for the Oil and Gas sector at second position.

Healthcare sector’s weightage reached a 40-month high of 8 percent

Stocks exhibiting a maximum increase in value MoM were Reliance Industries (up Rs 113.1 billion) HDFC Bank (Rs 81.6 billion) ICICI Bank (Rs 76.3 billion), Bharti Airtel (Rs 45.8 billion) and Infosys (Rs 43.3 billion)

In terms of value decline MoM, the top five stocks were HUL (Rs 7.3 billion), Tech Mahindra (Rs 5.3 billion), Aditya Birla Fashion (Rs 5 billion), RBL Bank (Rs 4.4 billion) and SBI (Rs 3.8 billion).

Last month, mutual funds were net buyers in 44 percent of stocks.

Highest net buying in April over March was witnessed in Wipro (up 23.7 percent), Hero Moto (up 13.6 percent), Eicher Motors (up 12.7 percent), UPL (up 10.1 percent) and UltraTech (up 5.5 percent).

Number crunching

In April, Nifty bounced back 14.7 percent, the best month since May 2009.

Improvement in performance of global markets, intermittent news flow around development of the COVID-19 vaccine, significant moderation in FII selling and deep value in several sectors provided an encouraging backdrop for Indian markets to recoup some of their previous losses in the month of April.

In April, the total assets under management of the mutual fund industry stood at 23.52 lakh crore down from Rs 24.70 lakh crore in March 2020.

Overall, the equity category witnessed net inflows of Rs 6,213 crores

Contribution of systematic investment plans (SIPs) moderated to Rs 83.8 billion down 3 percent MoM after hitting a new high of Rs 86.4 bln in March 2020."

The company reported a consolidated profit of Rs 6,348 crore during the January-March quarter 2020, registering a decline of 45.5 percent QoQ and 38.7 percent YoY.

The loss was primarily driven by a slump in oil prices, however, Jio Platforms' impressive 72.7 percent sequential growth limited the decline.

edited excerpt:

Q) It seems like the markets seem to have witnessed profit-taking at higher levels. What led to a sharp sell-off on D – street and then some recovery to the close of the week?

A) Indian stock markets fell on both local as well as global cues. On the global front, the US President Donald Trump criticizing China’s handling of the Coronavirus pandemic unnerved investors, and on the domestic front, an extension of the nationwide lockdown dampened the sentiment.

Stocks dropped globally after the US President on Sunday said that Beijing misled the world about COVID-19.

On the domestic front, earnings and the economy would take time to revive even if all restrictions are lifted. The government may not ease the curbs anytime soon considering the number of new cases we are seeing every day.

All the above factors turned the investor's sentiments negative fuelled by global tensions which eventually led to the downfall of Nifty.

Global market trends turned positive following attempts to defuse tensions around the US-China trade talks, which ultimately led to the recovery of the domestic markets. Markets seem to be awaiting the announcement of a stimulus package from the government.

A) The market has been trying to move up, and now with global markets also bouncing back, investors are now feeling that the time for value buying has arrived.

The partial relaxation granted to less affected areas from lockdown will be helpful in reviving the economy in certain aspects and therefore investors seem to accumulate these stocks, but selling pressure likely at higher levels in small & midcap space.

A) Nifty’s movement next week may depend on the progress in the COVID-19 vaccine, hopes of a bigger fiscal stimulus from the government, expectations of a decline in daily novel Coronavirus cases.

There is likely to be some stock-specific action due to earnings. Volatility may remain higher in the coming week. Small and midcap stocks may witness selling pressure at higher levels.

A) The oil giant company has a firm belief that the data will be the next oil and it has been focusing more on the same platform.

With the introduction of Reliance Jio which had disrupted the telecom business, it had been continuously entering different sectors and making progress aggressively.

Many companies struggle to raise funds and for them, it might take years but that is not the case with Reliance Jio which is among one of the high values companies in India.

Within a short span of time, it has raised more than Rs. 60,000 cr. The latest deal is with the Vista Equity Partners for a stake of 2.32 percent which is valued around Rs. 11,000 cr.

The deals with tech giant Facebook which they combined planning to enter to the various businesses especially focusing on UPI payment platform and retail has boosted the valuation of the Reliance Industries.

We recommend investors to hold their position for the long term as the stock is expected to outperform the index.

Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.

A) In November 2019 Moody’s has downgraded India’s outlook from stable to negative with respect to the lower economic growth.

On Friday, in revision to that Moody’s stated that “India's rating outlook reflects the rising risk of slower GDP growth, low policy effectiveness.”

The already slow economic growth, less job creation, high debt burdens, and credit crunch among NBFC and others have highly contributed, in addition to that the outbreak of Coronavirus and the extension of lockdown had been highly impacted the economy of India.

On Friday, the benchmark indices have ended at 9521.50 or 0.57 percent positive. From the day's performance, we may conclude that the market has already discounted the Moody’s rating about India and investors are still in hope for another stimulus package and closely watching various treatment and vaccine options to the COVID-19.

A) With a growing number of cases of COVID 19 and the situation not getting under control, it looks like the lockdown will be extended in many parts of the country which are getting COVID-19 cases on a regular basis.

The situation is very dire, with no medicine/vaccine, and lockdown seems to be the only available and possible way to flatten the curve. This makes the probability of lockdown extension very high, at least for the affected areas.

Lockdown has already taken a toll on the economy. However, the lockdown may be relaxed in certain places and this would have mixed effects on markets and would make market choppier.

A) The COVID-19 panic has set pharma stocks on fire. Countries at present are halting exports of essential drugs, but this is only temporary. In the long term, the risk from protectionism on India's low-cost export model will be countered by its sheer price competitiveness.

After this pandemic, there could be significantly higher spending both by the government and private sector on healthcare, specialty chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.

There are supply-side challenges but the overall outlook is positive and hence investors can add these stocks (at dip) to their basket.

Relience_Industries,11-05-2020,"Reliance Industries reclaims Rs 10 lakh crore m-cap intraday, 2.6% away from record high","Reliance Industries, owner of the country's largest telecom operator Jio by subscriber base, has reclaimed Rs 10 lakh crore mark in market capitalisation intraday on May 11, but it closed slightly below that mark. Last it hit the level was on January 17, 2020.

The stock gained 0.96 percent to close at Rs 1,576.75, with a market cap of Rs 9,99,565.43 crore, after hitting an intraday high of Rs 1,614.85, taking total gains to 78 percent from closing lows of March, outperforming equity benchmark indices which gained around 21 percent from March lows.

The index is 2.6 percent away from its record high of Rs 1,617.80 seen on December 20 last year.

After the company announced its deleveraging plan in the AGM last year, the stock had picked up momentum and hit a record high in December.

However, it also fell sharply along with market turmoil in February-March due to COVID-19 crisis, but rebounded quite sharply than any other largecaps in April-May following strong growth in Reliance Jio and stake sale in Jio Platforms, the 100 percent subsidiary of RIL.

Reliance announced three back to back deals with private equity investors (Vista and Silver Lake) and Whatsapp's owner Facebook Inc, and garnered Rs 60,596.37 crore by selling 13.47 percent stake in Jio Platforms in less than three weeks.

""In the midst of all the chaos, Reliance Industries seems to have created its own bull market territory through a V-Shaped recovery by concerted efforts to bring quality investors, reduce its net debt and streamline its balance sheet,"" Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO at SAMCO Securities & StockNote told Moneycontrol.

RIL having the highest weight in Nifty50 is also keeping markets on a better footing which in a way is helping to neutralize negative sentiments and is good for the current pandemic-stricken economy, he said.

As a part of debt reduction, Reliance on April 30th also announced India's biggest rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore, with a ratio of 1:15 and a price of Rs 1,257 per share.

With strong visibility to these equity infusions, RIL is set to achieve net-zero debt status ahead of its own aggressive timeline (March 2021), Reliance said.

And in spite of the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdowns, the due-diligence by Saudi Aramco for the planned investment in the O2C business is on track as both the parties are committed and actively engaged, it added.

Relience_Industries,11-05-2020,"RIL share price climbs over 3%, looks to extend gains into 5th consecutive session","Reliance Industries (RIL) share price jumped more than 3 percent in the morning trade on BSE on May 11, looking to extend its winning streak into the fifth consecutive session.

The oil-to-retail major has been gaining after brokerages and analysts reacted positively on Reliance Industries’ Jio Platforms securing three back-to-back deals.

The three investments in Jio Platforms are expected to fast-track RIL’s target of emerging net debt-free on a net cash basis by March 2021.

On April 22, Facebook announced its decision to invest Rs 43,574 crore in Jio Platforms for a 9.99 percent stake.

Silver Lake on May 4 said it would invest Rs 5,655.75 crore for a 1.15 percent stake at an equity value of Rs 4.90 lakh crore. Four days later, Vista Equity Partners picked a 2.32 percent stake for Rs 11,367 crore.

Overall, experts remain bullish on the stock given its current and expected growth in telecom and digital business and the company’s deleveraging plan. They feel the deal with Facebook will boost Reliance Retail's business and help RIL grow much faster.

On April 30, RIL announced India's biggest rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore at Rs 1,257 per share.

In a BSE filing on May 9, the company announced May 14 as the ‘Record Date’ for the purpose of the rights issue.

edited excerpts:

Q: Do you think the central government and state governments will increase taxes on non-essential goods and services, and also on rich to make up the fiscal deficit if they announce a bigger stimulus package? What are other things government can do to maintain fiscal deficit?

Such a move if any may be termed as farfetched as high-income group taxes are already on the higher end and also do not contribute significantly to the government's kitty, while putting it on all non-essential goods may not be practically possible.

It is even possible to say on super-luxury category or imported goods BUT they too don't contribute significantly to government kitty, however, looking at the current situation they aren't improbable. The government may try to loosen up the FDI norms to set up manufacturing facilities in India, incentivise the exports, introduce higher rate long term government bonds and may tap supranational entities for deficit funding.

Q: Reliance Industries as an index heavyweight supported the market strongly in a weak sentiment. Do you think the company will sell more stake in the coming days, and as a result will not go for Reliance Jio IPO? Also, do you think the stock will cross Rs 2,000 mark by Diwali?

With more stake being sold, the Jio IPO possibilities solidify as at some point these investors will want an exit which looking from current juncture seems they can get only from an IPO. We do not expect any incremental significant stake sale.

Also, with low demand of fuel and petroleum products amid COVID-19, we do not expect the refinery vertical to perform well while Jio may continue to do well, implying an overall muted performance and hence stock rallying to Rs 2,000 by Diwali seems unlikely. Any rise in price above levels of Rs 1,700-1,800 may witness strong profit booking.

Q: After a 600 points correction in the Nifty last week, do you think the market will break 7,500 in May if the lockdown is extended and COVID cases continue to rise?

If the situation intensifies in terms of rise in the number of cases and deaths, the probability of sharp fall increases. In red zones the lockdown is expected to extend beyond May 17 and thereby even if the restrictions are eased in green zones inter-district/interstate travel will not be allowed.

Q: What are the major factors to look at in the coming week which can direct market on either side?

Major factors will continue to remain monitoring of rising cases in India and globally, any discovery of treatment drug and vaccine, and global cues from commodity and oil markets.

Q: Smallcap and Midcap indices fell 4-5 percent last week, but outperformed benchmark indices. Do you think there has been buying in beaten-down quality stocks? What are your top three picks that can create value for shareholders?

Midcap and smallcap stocks can outperform in next 1 to 2 years. But from lower levels, because from last 1 month many stocks have risen by 30-50 percent, better to wait for lower levels for fresh investment.

Relience_Industries,09-05-2020,"Nifty defends Gann number 91(00) but lacks conviction, RIL seen at record high next week","Pritesh Mehta

Not the ideal start to life for bulls in the month of May as Nifty succumbed to a cut of 5.7 percent in the very first session of the month. Negative set of cues from global markets resulted in a gap-down opening. Presence of multiple hurdles around the 10,000-mark after a sharp rally last month, contributed to Nifty's inability to sustain the top.

However, despite this week's negative returns of 6 percent, Nifty has done well to defend two-digit Gann number of 91(00). In Wednesday's session, it marked a low of 9,119 and staged a sharp rally. Comeback of RIL in second half of the week provided the index much required ammo to continue Wednesday's recovery.

On point and figure (P&F) chart, Reliance Industries (RIL) has triggered a double top buy pattern, set-up has turned bullish and it is likely to re-test its all-time high in next week's trade. Ratio of RIL against Nifty shows strong outperformance with formations of double top. However, Banks & Financials are still underperforming.

Two-digit Gann number 91(00) & midpoint of the previous trading range i.e. 9,100 have acted as a support in this week's trade. Even anchor point zone is placed around the same (i.e, 9,100) on the P&F chart from the low of April's upmove and previous week's peak.

Meanwhile, Friday's trade has surely left a bittersweet taste for market participants, because positive global cues and a sharp rally in opening trade resulted in day’s high of 9,383. However, things changed in second half as BankNifty turned negative and closed below 19,500 mark. So only HUL, RIL and select pharma companies kept the index in the green while others were struggling.

During a period where market is creating whipsaws, Nifty would gain credence on a convincing move above 9,350 (i.e. midpoint of current two-digit Gann channel) towards the 9,600 mark.

So, confluence of support provided respite in this week's trade and thereby respected the point of polarity zone. However, sell on rallies and buy on declines movement (evident post a fall from 9,900 levels) has led to a choppy environment on Dalal Street. Choppy market is not an ideal time to make money on the index.

Ratio chart of FMCG/Nifty50 saw a sharp correction of more than 15 percent in last few weeks driven mainly by HUL. However, ratio has bounced back from pattern re-test zone. Even momentum indicators have reversed, marking a higher low in the process. Post recent correction, HUL, Britannia & Nestle are expected to outperform from the FMCG space.

Edited excerpts:

Q) It seems markets have witnessed profit-taking at higher levels. What led to the sharp selloff on D-Street and then some recovery towards the close of the week?

A) As per statistics, Indian markets and the US have shown the highest correlation in the past month compared to the last decade. Hence, Monday was no different when Indian markets reacted in line with its global peers and witnessed crack in prices.

However, the latter half was comparatively buoyant since heavyweights such as Reliance Industries managed to keep markets afloat.

Additionally, sentiments were guided by the opening of factories in certain states, which helped recovery on D-Street towards the end of the week.

Q) Any factors that investors should watch out for in the coming week?

A) Until the lockdown ends, the situation at the ground will not be known, till then markets are expected to continue in a narrow range. Indices should take another 2-3 months to show significant cracks once again.

Markets will continue to be lackluster unless there is a fiscal stimulus announced which will indeed be accepted by the Street with open arms.

Q) Another mega deal for RIL’s Jio platform. What are your views and estimates on the stock and what should investors do?

A) Reliance Industries is playing its cards very smartly as it has single-handedly formed its own bull path. When the entire market is in a state of chaos, (Mukesh) Ambani announced three back-to-back deals along with a rights issue.

The future of Reliance Jio will depend on how effectively these deals help the platform to grow and achieve the scale it plans. However, for now, investors can hold the stock until the rights issue and dividend record date to capitalise on the gains.

A) Broader markets have substantially recovered but not all stocks would prove to be outstanding wealth-creators in the long run. A crack in the larger weights will eventually trickle down to the small and midcaps, taking them lower in times to come.

Traditionally, bear markets have lasted for a minimum of 18 months and this time isn’t expected to be different. Hence, there is still more pain left.

Investors should, therefore, patiently wait and get into sectoral leaders to prevent wealth erosion in the coming months.

Q) Moody's says India's negative rating outlook reflects a rising risk of slower GDP growth. Do you think this is factored in or will it weigh on markets and investors?

A) Markets seem to have factored in the pain, for now, given that despite the rise in daily COVID cases or negative outlook markets moved higher.

Post the lockdown, the ground-level pain will be a key data point that might lead investors to react in the markets. These reactions will be negative and ugly if the lockdown lasts longer.

Q) Do you think the lockdown will be extended beyond May 17? If yes, what will it do to the market?

A) An extension of the lockdown seems unlikely since the economy is bleeding. Currently, markets are expecting the lockdown to be lifted on May 17, however, any further extension will cause a downward movement.

Even if Mumbai and other metro cities remain in extended lockdown, the effect will be extremely negative for the economy.

Q) Specialty chemicals and pharma sectors are best placed do ride out the COVID-19 storm but, after a swift rally, are they still a good buy?

A) The pharmaceutical sector was in a long-term downtrend and faced massive pressure for the past few years. Since this is a health hazard, any positive news will take the pharma stocks zooming.

However, they can turn out to be bull traps, which we witnessed last week. Hence, investors should wait for the earnings to assess the impact of the situation on these companies.

Specialty chemicals, on the other hand, can be good from a long-term perspective since the supply from China may be shifted and Indian players are expected to gain a place in the specialty space on the world map.

However, only investors who are aggressive risk-takers should buy fundamentally stronger specialty chemical stocks.

Though current valuations are lower and they have remained so for quite sometime, only a rerating of earnings multiple will bring excellent gains in the specialty sector, which, in turn, depends on the actual bargaining power of Indian companies in the global spectrum.

Relience_Industries,08-05-2020,"Jio-Vista deal: RIL m-cap near Rs 10 lakh crore, stock up 77% from March lows","Oil-telecom-to-retail major Reliance Industries (RIL) was the only big gainer among Nifty constituents on May 8.

The index heavyweight shot up 76.7 percent from its March lows and is just 3.6 percent away from its record high of Rs 1,617.8 now, whereas the Nifty is up only 20 percent from its March lows.

The stock had fallen 45.5 percent in three months from its record high seen in December last year, but took only a month-and-a- half to recover almost all gains.

RIL is back near its Rs 10 lakh crore market capitalisation (m-cap). As per its May 8 closing price, the company's m-cap stood at 9,90,088.02 crore.

All credit goes to the three back-to-back deals that took place in Jio Platforms, the 100 percent subsidiary of RIL. This is as per its deleveraging plan, or target of emerging net debt free on a net cash basis by March 2021.

On April 22, Facebook announced its decision to invest Rs 43,574 crore in Jio Platforms for a 9.99 percent stake.

Silver Lake on May 4 decided to invest Rs 5,655.75 crore for a 1.15 percent stake, at an equity value of Rs 4.90 lakh crore. On May 8, Vista Equity Partners said it would invest Rs 11,367 crore for a 2.32 percent equity stake.

Jio Platforms has now raised Rs 60,596.37 crore from leading technology investors in less than three weeks.

On April 30, RIL announced India's biggest rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore at Rs 1,257 per share.

Overall experts remain bullish on the stock given its current and expected growth in telecom as well as digital business, and its strong deleveraging plan. They feel the deal with Facebook will boost Reliance Retail's business and help RIL grow much faster in coming years.

Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, advises investors to hold the stock till the rights issue and dividend record date to capitalise on the gains.

Last week, RIL informed the exchanges it expects to complete the capital raising programme totalling over Rs 1.04 lakh crore by Q1 FY21. ""This includes investment by Facebook in Jio Platforms, the upcoming rights issue and the previous investment by British Petroleum in FY20.""

Relience_Industries,08-05-2020,PE deals will help Jio scale up business faster with unique ideas: Experts,"Vista Equity Partners will pick up a 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 11,367 crore, making it the third high-profile investment in Reliance Industries' unit in as many weeks.

Experts feel the deleveraging process seems to be on a fast track and huge digital opportunities going ahead will take Jio to new scale in terms of business as well as valuations.

""Firstly from value of $50 billion that Facebook had given to now new deal at a premium to even the Facebook deal, 12.5 percent premium, suggested a value of $63-64 billion for Jio Platforms. So at the current level itself there is a scope for higher valuations,"" Jal Irani, Senior Vice-President - Wholesale Capital Markets at Edelweiss Financial Services told CNBC-TV18.

""Potential for growth tends to be extremely significant and it is how Reliance will execute this growth which will drive value going forward,"" he said.

Siddhartha Khemka, VP - Head of Research (Retail) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services also told Moneycontrol that it is definitely a positive deal with global private equity firms which generally invest for 4-5 years and they are big tech PE firms with large business sense and ideas.

""Net-net the money will be good for their capex and growth plans. With long term support from such PE investors, they can get more ideas from global companies where they invest globally, which will ultimately help Reliance to scale up business very fast in coming years,"" he said.

This investment values Jio Platforms at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore, company in its BSE filing said, adding Vista's investment will translate into a 2.32 percent equity stake in Jio Platforms on a fully diluted basis, making Vista the largest investor in Jio Platforms behind Reliance Industries and Facebook.

""I already said they will be monetising total 15 percent stake, of which they already completed 13.47 percent stake sale (to Facebook, Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners) and the rest around 1.5 percent will give them additional Rs 7,500 crore. And another 10 percent stake will be retained for IPO which may be likely by March 2021. So Reliance Industries eventually will be wanting to keep 70-75 percent stake of Jio Platforms with themselves,"" SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18.

He said so net around Rs 68,000 crore will come in Jio Platforms, and Rs 54,000 crore of rights issue, making total of around Rs 1.22 lakh crore, while the net debt as of March 31, 2020 is Rs 1.61 lakh crore. They are still short of around Rs 40,000 crore which the company needs to garner.

""If I add FY21 cashflow of RIL on standalone basis that gives me around Rs 25,000 crore. Then also there is still a shortage of around Rs 20,000 crore,"" he added.

He said Jio Platforms also has debt of Rs 25,000 crore and they would be requiring capex of Rs 30,000-50,000 crore on annual basis as they may be upgrading their technology to 5G.

Hence, Tulsian said eventually the market would be looking that Saudi Aramco deal has to happen. ""Originally it was envisaged to be happening at $75 on EV valuation of O2C business. Now I am expecting that to be around $60 a barrel. Even if I take 20 percent dilution of stake that gives me around $12 billion dollars or Rs 90,000 crore.""

""So we have about Rs 54,000 crore from rights issue, Rs 90,000 crore from Saudi Aramco deal and Rs 25,000 crore of cash flow FY21 from RIL standalone that makes the perfect equation,"" he said.

Siddhartha Khemka feels if debt comes down, the debt rating will improve which will help the company to reduce the cost of debt and as a result overall debt cost of Reliance Industries will also come down.

According to him, Reliance Jio IPO is unlikely before at least next three years given the investment by these PE firms. ""Jio Platforms is doing very well and if they continue with small stake sale with global investors then they might not need to do Jio IPO also in future.""

Validation for Jio’s tech-enterprise prowess

The latest investment reaffirms Jio as a strong tech-enterprise focused on one of the most exciting and large markets in the world and emphasises the quality of management. Vista’s investment showcases Jio as the next-generation software and platform company.

Relience_Industries,04-05-2020,Rights issue credit positive for Reliance Industries; to result in debt reduction: Moody's,"Moody's Investors Service on Monday said Reliance Industries' Rs 53,100 crore rights issue is credit positive as earnings will decline because of economic shutdowns. Last week, Reliance announced it will raise Rs 53,100 crore through a rights equity offering.

Also, the company announced an investment of Rs 5,656 crore by Silver Late in Jio Platforms, the digital services business of RIL.

""This is in line with the company's target to reduce its net debt to zero by March 31, 2021. The proceeds from the rights issue will reduce RIL's net debt by about $7.8 billion and is credit positive,"" Moody's said in a note.

Along with the previously announced asset sales to Facebook, Inc and BP Plc, RIL expects to generate net proceeds of Rs 1.1 lakh crore, which will reduce its net debt by the same amount.

""The total net debt reduction from completion of these transactions will lower RIL's reported net debt, which was Rs 1.6 lakh crore ($21.4 billion) as on March 31, 2020, by about 68 per cent and will be equivalent to 1.1x its reported EBITDA of Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020,"" it said.

In addition, RIL also announced that it has started the process to carve out its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business as a separate subsidiary in order to facilitate the previously announced 20 per cent stake sale in that business to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).

Despite the coronavirus outbreak and lower oil prices, RIL confirmed that the due diligence process for the transaction is ongoing.

""This increases the likelihood of the transaction going ahead as announced in August 2019,"" the rating agency said, adding the transaction with Saudi Aramco values the O2C business at $75 billion and can potentially result in $12-15 billion of cash proceeds for RIL, depending on the amount of debt at the O2C business after the reorganization.

Reliance last week approved the biggest-ever rights issue of Rs 53,100 crore at Rs 1,257 per share.

The company had reported a 10.5 per cent increase in its reported EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to a year ago.

While the economic shutdowns due to coronavirus outbreak resulted in a decline in earnings from RIL's O2C and retail businesses for the quarter ended March 2020, its earnings from its digital services continued to grow.

""We expect the earnings from its O2C and retail business to see a steeper decline in the quarter ending June 2020 as India's economy is scheduled to be under shutdown for at least 45 days in this quarter. An earnings recovery for these segments will depend on the timing of resumption of economic activity, which remains uncertain at this stage,"" it said.

Assuming the economic activity to resume by middle to end of May 2020, the rating agency expected RIL's consolidated EBITDA to decline 10-12 per cent in FY2021 as compared to FY2020. However, the EBITDA is expected to return to FY2020 levels in FY2022 as improved demand in combination with low oil prices will result in higher earnings for the O2C segment, while the earnings growth for retail will resume.

""RIL's recent foray into online retail through its partnership with Whatsapp and Facebook could result in a further boost in its retail earnings, which is currently not factored in our projections,"" Moody's said."
Relience_Industries,04-05-2020,Reliance Jio-Silver Lake deal boosts confidence; experts see re-rating of stock,"The investment by private equity firm Silver Lake into Reliance Industries' Jio Platforms following Facebook deal and rights issue is clearly a confidence booster to shareholders, analysts and corporates when the COVID-19 spoiled the entire environment.

""Facebook deal was on right time and now Silver Lake is definitely positive Reliance. Also it is a big sentiment booster for the stock, though it is a future development and not current development,"" Ajay Jaiswal, Stock Market Strategist told Moneycontrol.

""Deal is much needed for Reliance Industries when there is a delay in Saudi Aramco deal though the company said due diligence is still on,"" he said.

Shailendra Kumar, CIO at Narnolia Financial Services also said deals were also showing way for positive momentum for Indian corporates in current environment of COVID-19-led lockdown started in last week of March.

Reliance Industries in its BSE filing on May 4 said Silver Lake would invest Rs 5,655.75 crore into Jio Platforms for over a 1 percent equity stake.

""This investment values Jio Platforms at an equity value of Rs 4.90 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.15 lakh crore and represents a 12.5 percent premium to the equity valuation of the Facebook investment announced on April 22, 2020,"" it added.

Last month, Facebook picked up 9.99 percent equity stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 43,574 crore.

Experts feel the deal also indicated that there is lot of demand for such kind of businesses from global investors as RIL moved to next-generation technology company.

""The Silver Lake news coming right after the Rights Issue and Facebook deal is indicative of the fact that there is lot of interest from global players to participate in the digital growth story and people will jump the fence,"" Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital Management told CNBC-TV18.

“After the Facebook deal, nobody thought that the re-rating could happen in 4 days. It has given tremendous confidence to shareholders of RIL. Silver Lake is an active PE player and has investments in Airbnb, Expedia, and Twitter, etc.,” he said.

Shailendra Kumar, CIO at Narnolia Financial Services also said the deal clearly indicated that henceforth core business of Reliance is consumer and not oil.

""Reliance Jio and Retail will drive topline and EBITDA going forward. Suddenly the company turned from old-fashioned business to new age company where the whole excitement is coming,"" he added.

Whatsapp getting local stores connected, where the business opportunity is humongous, and the stock rerating will definitely happen as it is showing confidence to other corporates in the current market environment.

Jio Platforms, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, is a next-generation technology company building a Digital Society for India by bringing together Jio's leading digital apps, digital ecosystems and India's #1 high-speed connectivity platform under one umbrella, said Reliance.

Reliance Jio Infocomm, which provides connectivity platform to over 388 million subscribers, will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jio Platforms.

The company said Jio has brought transformational changes in the Indian digital services space and propelled India on the path towards becoming a global technology leader and among the leading digital economies in the world.

""With the imminent carving out of O2C (refining & petrochemicals) business soon; Reliance Jio is well on it's way to emerge as a pure digital play with characteristics akin to a FAANG stock. Jio platform would continue to be the first port of call for investors keen to bet on India's 130 crore strong population that is rapidly embracing digital services including e-commerce,"" Ajay Bodke, CEO PMS at Prabhudas Lilladher told Moneycontrol.

He remains extremely positive on the Chairman’s transformational vision and the leading role played by the next generation of promoters Akash and Isha Ambani in steering this venture.

Given the target of making Reliance net debt free by March 31, 2021 and strong developments towards the target, the re-rating is expected to happen soon, experts feel.

""Whatsapp-Jio getting local stores connected, where the business opportunity is humongous, and hence the stock rerating will definitely happen as it is showing confidence to other corporates in the current market environment. We are eagerly waiting for the company's plan of this deal,"" Shailendra Kumar said.

Vikas Halan, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, Moody’s Investors Service said Silver Lake's investment in Jio Platforms further illustrated Reliance Industries' (RI, Baa2 stable) ability and willingness to monetize its digital services business and reinforces the company's commitment to achieve a zero net debt position by March 31, 2021.

""Investment by Silver Lake is priced at a premium to recently announced investment by Facebook Inc. ($5.8 billion) and establishes another pricing benchmark for Jio Platforms. This is credit positive as it enhances RIL's already strong financial flexibility,"" he added.

Including the recently announced rights issue ($7 billion) and investments by Silver Lake and Facebook Inc, RIL has announced initiatives that could reduce net debt by about $13.6 billion from reported net debt of $21.4 billion as on March 31, 2020, Vikas said.

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities

Following the clue given by Reliance at the time of Facebook investment that it is in good shape to announce a similar-sized investment in the coming months, the investment by Silver Lake Partners to acquire 1.15 percent stake in Jio Platforms is welcome. The 12.5 percent higher valuation in this round may be due to much smaller investment by Silver Lake (compared to Facebook) and the fact that unlike Facebook they would operationally not bring any benefit on table.

Also currently private equity investors seem to have more capital than they know what to do with. This announcement has helped to partly offset the negative effect on the stock price of subdued Q4FY20 results announced by the company on April 30.
